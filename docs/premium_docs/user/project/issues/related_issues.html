<p>Linked issues are a bi-directional relationship between any two issues and appear in a block below
the issue description. You can link issues in different projects.</p>
<p>The relationship only shows up in the UI if the user can see both issues. When you try to close an
issue that has open blockers, a warning is displayed.</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>To manage linked issues through our API, see <a href="../../../api/issue_links.html">Issue links API</a>.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<h2>Add a linked issue</h2>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Guest role for both projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>To link one issue to another:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Linked items</strong> section of an issue,
   select the add linked issue button ({{&lt; icon name="plus" &gt;}}).</li>
<li>Select the relationship between the two issues. Either:</li>
<li><strong>relates to</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#blocking-issues">blocks</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#blocking-issues">is blocked by</a></strong></li>
<li>Input the issue number or paste in the full URL of the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Linking related issues with the current issue" src="img/related_issues_add_v15_3.png" /></p>
<p>Issues of the same project can be specified just by the reference number.
   Issues from a different project require additional information like the
   group and the project name. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same project: <code>#44</code></li>
<li>The same group: <code>project#44</code></li>
<li>Different group: <code>group/project#44</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Valid references are added to a temporary list that you can review.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you have added all the linked issues, select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have finished adding all linked issues, you can see
them categorized so their relationships can be better understood visually.</p>
<p><img alt="Section to view or manage related issues" src="img/related_issue_block_v15_3.png" /></p>
<p>You can also add a linked issue from a commit message or the description in another issue or MR.
For more information, see <a href="crosslinking_issues.html">Crosslinking issues</a>.</p>
<h2>Remove a linked issue</h2>
<p>In the <strong>Linked items</strong> section of an issue, select the remove button ({{&lt; icon name="close" &gt;}}) on the
right-side of each issue token to remove.</p>
<p>Due to the bi-directional relationship, the relationship no longer appears in either issue.</p>
<p><img alt="Unlinking a related issue from the current issue" src="img/related_issues_remove_v15_3.png" /></p>
<p>Access our <a href="../../permissions.html">permissions</a> page for more information.</p>
<h2>Blocking issues</h2>
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier: Premium, Ultimate</li>
<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you <a href="#add-a-linked-issue">add a linked issue</a>, you can show that it <strong>blocks</strong> or
<strong>is blocked by</strong> another issue.</p>
<p>Issues blocked by other issues have an icon ({{&lt; icon name="entity-blocked" &gt;}}) next to their title, shown in the
issue lists and <a href="../issue_board.html">boards</a>.
The icon disappears when the blocking issue is closed or their relationship is changed or
<a href="#remove-a-linked-issue">removed</a>.</p>
<p>If you try to close a blocked issue using the "Close issue" button, a confirmation message appears.</p></code></pre>
