<p>When you have a lot of issues, it can be hard to get an overview.
With weighted issues, you can get a better idea of how much time,
value, or complexity a given issue has or costs. You can also <a href="sorting_issue_lists.md#sorting-by-weight">sort by weight</a>
to see which issues need to be prioritized.</p>
<h2>View the issue weight</h2>
<p>You can view the issue weight on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right sidebar of each issue.</li>
<li>The issues page, next to a weight icon ({{&lt; icon name="weight" &gt;}}).</li>
<li><a href="../issue_board.html">Issue boards</a>, next to a weight icon ({{&lt; icon name="weight" &gt;}}).</li>
<li>The <a href="../milestones/_index.html">milestone</a> page, as a total sum of issue weights.</li>
</ul>
