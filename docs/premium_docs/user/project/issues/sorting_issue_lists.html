<p>You can sort a list of issues several ways.
The available sorting options can change based on the context of the list.</p>
<h2>Sorting by blocking issues</h2>
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier: Premium, Ultimate</li>
<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Blocking</strong>, the issue list changes to sort descending by the
number of issues each issue is <a href="related_issues.md#blocking-issues">blocking</a>.</p>
<h2>Sorting by created date</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Created date</strong>, the issue list changes to sort descending by the issue
creation date. Issues created most recently are first.</p>
<h2>Sorting by due date</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Due date</strong>, the issue list changes to sort ascending by the issue
<a href="due_dates.html">due date</a>. Issues with the earliest due date are first,
and issues without a due date are last.</p>
<h2>Sorting by label priority</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Label priority</strong>, the issue list changes to sort descending.
Issues with the highest priority label are first, then all other issues.</p>
<p>Ties are broken arbitrarily. Only the highest prioritized label is checked,
and labels with a lower priority are ignored.
For more information, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14523">issue 14523</a>.</p>
<p>To learn how to change label priority, see <a href="../labels.md#set-label-priority">Label priority</a>.</p>
<h2>Sorting by updated date</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Updated date</strong>, the issue list changes to sort by the time of a last
update. Issues changed the most recently are shown first.</p>
<h2>Manual sorting</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Manual</strong> order, you can change
the order by dragging and dropping the issues. The changed order persists, and
everyone who visits the same list sees the updated issue order, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Each issue is assigned a relative order value, representing its relative
order with respect to the other issues on the list. When you drag-and-drop reorder
an issue, its relative order value changes.</p>
<p>In addition, any time an issue appears in a manually sorted list,
the updated relative order value is used for the ordering.
So, if anyone drags issue <code>A</code> above issue <code>B</code> in your GitLab instance,
this ordering is maintained whenever they appear together in any list.</p>
<p>This ordering also affects <a href="../issue_board.md#ordering-issues-in-a-list">issue boards</a>.
Changing the order in an issue list changes the ordering in an issue board,
and the other way around.</p>
<h2>Sorting by milestone due date</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Milestone due date</strong>, the issue list changes to sort ascending by the
assigned milestone due date. Issues with milestones with the earliest due date are first,
then issues with a milestone without a due date.</p>
<h2>Sorting by popularity</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Popularity</strong>, the issue order changes to sort descending by the
number of upvotes (<a href="../../emoji_reactions.html">emoji reactions</a> with the "thumbs up")
on each issue. You can use this to identify issues that are in high demand.</p>
<p>The total number of votes is not summed up. An issue with 18 upvotes and 5
downvotes is considered more popular than an issue with 17 upvotes and no
downvotes.</p>
<h2>Sorting by priority</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Priority</strong>, the issue order changes to sort in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Issues with milestones that have due dates, where the soonest assigned milestone is listed first.</li>
<li>Issues with milestones with no due dates.</li>
<li>Issues with a higher priority label.</li>
<li>Issues without a prioritized label.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ties are broken arbitrarily.</p>
<p>To learn how to change label priority, see <a href="../labels.md#set-label-priority">Label priority</a>.</p>
<h2>Sorting by title</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Title</strong>, the issue order changes to sort alphabetically by the issue
title in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emoji</li>
<li>Special characters</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Letters: first Latin, then accented (for example, <code>ö</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sorting by health status</h2>
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier: Ultimate</li>
<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/377841">Introduced</a> in GitLab 15.7.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Health</strong>, the issue list changes to sort by the
<a href="managing_issues.md#health-status">health status</a> of the issues
When in descending order, the issues are shown in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>At risk</strong> issues</li>
<li><strong>Needs attention</strong> issues</li>
<li><strong>On track</strong> issues</li>
<li>All other issues</li>
</ol>
<h2>Sorting by weight</h2>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Weight</strong>, the issue list changes to sort ascending by the
<a href="issue_weight.html">issue weight</a>.
Issues with lowest weight are first, and issues without a weight are last.</p>
<h2>Sorting by status</h2>

<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/576610">Generally available</a> in GitLab 18.6. Feature flag <code>work_item_status_mvc2</code> removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you sort by <strong>Status</strong>, the issue list changes to sort ascending by the
<a href="../../work_items/status.html">issue status</a>.
Issues are first sorted by their status category. If two issues share the same category, the system falls back to sorting by issue ID.</p></code></pre>
