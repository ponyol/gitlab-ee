<p>The merge request review process ensures that subject matter experts review your proposed changes
before they are merged. Reviewers add review comments to merge requests, and <a href="suggestions.html">suggest changes</a>
the author can apply directly from the GitLab UI.</p>
<p>Reviewers can use any of these tools to review a merge request:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GitLab interface.</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code, with the
  <a href="../../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/_index.html">GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code</a>.</li>
<li>A terminal window, with the <a href="../../../../editor_extensions/gitlab_cli/_index.html">GitLab CLI</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approvals are one of several merge checks that ensure your merge request merges only when it's truly
ready. Depending on your project configuration, reviewers can also block a merge request
from merging by setting <strong>Request changes</strong>.</p>
<p>GitLab Premium and Ultimate provide an <strong>Assign reviewers</strong> drawer with more information to help you
find reviewers <a href="#find-reviewers-who-fulfill-approval-rules">who fulfill approval rules</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="This merge request requires four approvals, and three of the approval requirements are not met." src="img/reviewer_drawer_v18_2.png" /></p>
<p>By following the <a href="#start-a-review">defined review flow</a>, each reviewer decides whether to accept or reject a merge request.
The right sidebar shows the list of reviewers, and (if they follow the review flow) their review status:</p>
<p><img alt="Examples of reviewers in various states of review." src="img/reviewer_list_v18_2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>{{&lt; icon name="dash-circle" &gt;}} Review not yet started.</li>
<li>{{&lt; icon name="status_running" &gt;}} Review is in progress.</li>
<li>{{&lt; icon name="check-circle" &gt;}} Reviewed and approved.</li>
<li>{{&lt; icon name="comment-lines" &gt;}} Reviewed, requested changes, and
  <a href="#prevent-merge-when-you-request-changes">blocked this merge request</a> until changes are made.
  This block <a href="#prevent-merge-when-you-request-changes">can be bypassed</a>.</li>

<h2>Find merge requests to review</h2>
<p>Your <a href="../homepage.html">merge request homepage</a> shows your merge requests in progress, and merge requests
awaiting review from you. The merge requests you need to review are in the <strong>Review requested</strong> category.
To see all merge requests that need your attention, use one of these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd> <a href="../../../shortcuts.html">keyboard shortcut</a>.</li>
<li>On the left sidebar, select <strong>Merge requests</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="merge-request"&gt;}}).</li>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong>, then, from the dropdown list, select <strong>Merge requests I'm working on</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>View the review status of a merge request</h2>
<p>To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Code</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong> and find your merge request.</li>
<li>Select the title of the merge request to view it.</li>
<li>Scroll to the <a href="../widgets.html">merge request widget</a> to see the mergeability and
   approval status for the merge request. For example, the lack of required approvals blocks this merge request:</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="The merge request widget displays 'All required approvals must be given'." src="img/reviews_missing_v17_3.png" /></p>
<h2>Request a review</h2>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assign reviewers</strong> drawer <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12878">introduced</a> in GitLab 17.5 <a href="../../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.html">with a flag</a> named <code>reviewer_assign_drawer</code>.</li>
<li>Drawer <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/467205">enabled</a> on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed in GitLab 17.5.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/467205">Feature flag</a> <code>reviewer_assign_drawer</code> removed in GitLab 17.8.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you've finished preparing your changes, it's time to request a review. To assign a reviewer to
your merge request, either use the
<a href="../../quick_actions.md#assign_reviewer"><code>/assign_reviewer</code> quick action</a> in any text field, or:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Code</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong> and find your merge request.</li>
<li>Select the title of the merge request to view it.</li>
<li>To find a reviewer by name: on the right sidebar, in the <strong>Reviewers</strong> section, select <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
<li>To find a reviewer who fulfills an approval rule in GitLab Premium and Ultimate:</li>
<li>On the right sidebar, in the <strong>Reviewers</strong> section, select <strong>Assign</strong> to open the <strong>Assign reviewers</strong> drawer.</li>
<li>For each approval rule, select <strong>Edit</strong> to find a reviewer who fulfills that approval rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>GitLab adds the merge request to the user's review requests.</p>
<h3>Find reviewers who fulfill approval rules</h3>
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier: Premium, Ultimate</li>
<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>GitLab Premium and Ultimate help you more quickly find the best reviewers for your merge request.
Use the <strong>Assign reviewers</strong> drawer to filter lists of reviewers. See the Code Owners for the files
changed in your merge request, and the users who satisfy your project's approval rules.</p>
<p>In this example, the merge request requires 3 Code Owner approvals, but has none so far:</p>
<p><img alt="The Assign Reviewers drawer for a merge request that requires 3 Code Owner approvals, but has none. It shows one line per Code Owner rule, and one line per approval rule. Select reviewers for each rule." src="img/select_good_reviewers_v17_5.png" /></p>
<p>To assign eligible approvers in a merge request:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Reviewers</strong> section, select <strong>Assign</strong>.</li>
<li>To see optional approval rules or Code Owners, select <strong>Optional approval rules</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="chevron-lg-up" &gt;}}) to show them.</li>
<li>Next to the reviewer type you need, select <strong>Edit</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Code Owners</strong> shows only the Code Owners for that file type.</li>
<li><strong>Approval rules</strong> shows only users who fulfill that approval rule.</li>
<li>Select your desired reviewer. (GitLab Premium and Ultimate enable you to select more than one reviewer.)</li>
<li>Repeat for each required <strong>Code Owner</strong> and <strong>Approval rule</strong> item.</li>
<li>When you've selected your reviewers, in the upper right, select <strong>Close</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="close" &gt;}})
   to hide the <strong>Assign reviewers</strong> drawer.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Re-request a review</h3>
<p>After a reviewer completes their <a href="../../../discussions/_index.html">merge request reviews</a>,
the author of the merge request can request a new review from the reviewer.
To do this, either use the <code>/request_review @user</code> quick action in any text field on the merge request, or:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Code</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong> and find your merge request.</li>
<li>Select the title of the merge request to view it.</li>
<li>If you have collapsed the right sidebar in the merge request, select the
   {{&lt; icon name="chevron-double-lg-left" &gt;}} <strong>Expand Sidebar</strong> to expand it.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Reviewers</strong> section, select the <strong>Re-request a review</strong> icon ({{&lt; icon name="redo" &gt;}})
   next to the reviewer's name.</li>
</ol>
<p>GitLab creates a new <a href="../../../todos.html">to-do item</a> for the reviewer, and sends
them a notification email.</p>
<h2>Start a review</h2>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>

</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>When reviewing a merge request, follow the review process instead of leaving individual
comments. When you select <strong>Start a review</strong>, the <strong>Reviewers</strong> section of the right sidebar updates
your status from <strong>Awaiting review</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="dash-circle"&gt;}}) to
<strong>Reviewer started review</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="comment-dots"&gt;}})</p>
<p>To start your review of a merge request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either:</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> to go to your <strong>Review requests</strong> page.</li>

<li>
<p>Update your status in the right sidebar to <strong>Reviewer started review</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="comment-dots"&gt;}}).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save your review comment, but leave it unpublished, like this:</p>
<p><img alt="An unpublished multi-line review comment shown as 'Pending'." src="img/pending_state_v18_1.png" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you select <strong>Add comment now</strong> instead of <strong>Start a review</strong>, GitLab publishes your comment immediately.</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue writing review comments on the <strong>Changes</strong> tab or the <strong>Overview</strong> tab.
   Selecting <strong>Add to review</strong> keeps them unpublished until you submit your review:</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="New thread" src="img/mr_review_new_comment_v16_6.png" /></p>
<p>Next, submit your review.</p>

<p>If you previously requested changes, you can remove your change request. You might need to do this
if both of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can no longer approve the merge request.</li>
<li>You want to cancel your change request, but don't want to submit a new review.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove your change request without submitting a new review:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Code</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong> and find your merge request.</li>
<li>Select the title of the merge request to view it.</li>

<li>Select <strong>Code</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong> and find your merge request.</li>
<li>Select the title of the merge request to view it.</li>
