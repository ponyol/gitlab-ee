title: Merge request approval rules</p>
<hr />
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier: Premium, Ultimate</li>
<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>Approval rules define how many <a href="_index.html">approvals</a> a merge request must receive before it can
be merged, and which users should do the approving. They can be used in conjunction
with <a href="#code-owners-as-approvers">code owners</a> to ensure that changes are
reviewed both by the group maintaining the feature, and any groups responsible
for specific areas of oversight.</p>
<p>You can define approval rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#add-an-approval-rule">As project defaults</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#edit-or-override-merge-request-approval-rules">Per merge request</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure approval rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../../administration/merge_requests_approvals.html">For the entire instance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't define a <a href="#add-an-approval-rule">default approval rule</a>,
any user can approve a merge request. Even if you don't define a rule, you can still
enforce a <a href="settings.html">minimum number of required approvers</a> in the project's settings.</p>
<p>Merge requests that target a different project, such as from a fork to the upstream project,
use the default approval rules from the target (upstream) project, not the source (fork).</p>
<p>Merge request approvals can be configured globally to apply across all (or a subset) projects with <a href="../../../application_security/policies/_index.html">policies</a>. <a href="../../../application_security/policies/merge_request_approval_policies.html">Merge request approval policies</a> also provide additional flexibility with more granular configuration options.</p>
<h2>Add an approval rule</h2>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.</li>
<li>To add a group as an approver in GitLab.com, you must be a member of the group or the
  group must be public.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a merge request approval rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Merge request approvals</strong> section, in the <strong>Approval rules</strong> section, select
   <strong>Add approval rule</strong>.</li>
<li>On the right sidebar, complete the fields:</li>
<li>In <strong>Approvals required</strong>, a value of <code>0</code> makes
     <a href="#configure-optional-approval-rules">the rule optional</a>, and any number greater than <code>0</code>
     creates a required rule.
     Maximum number of required approvals is <code>100</code>.</li>
<li>From <strong>Add approvers</strong>, select users or groups that are
     <a href="#eligible-approvers">eligible to approve</a>.
     GitLab suggests approvers based on previous authors of the files changed by the merge request.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>. You can add <a href="#multiple-approval-rules">multiple approval rules</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your configuration for approval rule overrides determines if the new rule is applied
to existing merge requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <a href="settings.md#prevent-editing-approval-rules-in-merge-requests">approval rule overrides</a> are allowed,
  changes to these default rules are not applied to existing merge requests, except for
  changes to the <a href="#approvals-for-protected-branches">target branch</a> of the rule.</li>
<li>If approval rule overrides are not allowed, all changes to default rules
  are applied to existing merge requests. Any approval rules that were previously
  manually <a href="#edit-or-override-merge-request-approval-rules">overridden</a> during the
  period when approval rule overrides where allowed, are not modified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Edit an approval rule</h2>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.</li>
<li>To add a group as an approver in GitLab.com, you must be a member of the group or the
  group must be public.</li>
</ul>
<p>To edit a merge request approval rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Merge request approvals</strong> section, in the <strong>Approval rules</strong> section, next to the rule you want to edit, select <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
<li>On the right sidebar, edit the fields:</li>
<li>In <strong>Approvals required</strong>, a value of <code>0</code> makes
     <a href="#configure-optional-approval-rules">the rule optional</a>, and any number greater than <code>0</code>
     creates a required rule.
     Maximum number of required approvals is <code>100</code>.</li>
<li>To remove users or groups, identify the group or user to remove, and select <strong>Remove</strong>
     ({{&lt; icon name="remove" &gt;}}).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Delete an approval rule</h2>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>To delete a merge request approval rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Merge request approvals</strong> section, next to the rule you want to delete, select the trash can ({{&lt; icon name="remove" &gt;}}).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Remove approvers</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Multiple approval rules</h2>
<p>To enforce multiple approval rules on a merge request, add multiple default approval rules for a project.</p>
<p>When an <a href="#eligible-approvers">eligible approver</a> approves a merge request, it
reduces the number of approvals left (the <strong>Approvals</strong> column) for all rules that the approver belongs to:</p>
<p><img alt="Merge request approvals widget" src="img/mr_approvals_widget_v16_0.png" /></p>
<p><i class="fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i>
For an overview, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JQJ5821FrA">Multiple Approvers</a>.</p>
<h2>Get notified about all merge requests you can approve</h2>
<p>To get email notifications every time a merge request you're eligible to approve is created:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../profile/notifications.md#edit-notification-settings">Set your notification level</a> to <strong>Custom</strong>
  and select the <strong>Merge request you're eligible to approve is created</strong> event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Edit or override merge request approval rules</h2>
<p>You can override the merge request approval rules for a project by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing an existing merge request.</li>
<li>Creating a new merge request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project setting <a href="settings.md#prevent-editing-approval-rules-in-merge-requests">Prevent editing approval rules</a>
  is disabled.</li>
<li>One of the following must be true:</li>
<li>You have administrator access.</li>
<li>You are the author of the merge request, and have at least the Developer role in the project.</li>
<li>You have at least the Maintainer role for the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>To override approvers of a merge request:</p>
<ol>
<li>When <a href="../creating_merge_requests.html">creating a new merge request</a>, scroll to the <strong>Approval Rules</strong> section,
   and add or remove your desired approval rules before selecting <strong>Create merge request</strong>.</li>
<li>When viewing an existing merge request:</li>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Code</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong> and find your merge request.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll to the <strong>Approval Rules</strong> section.</li>
<li>Add or remove your desired approval rules.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Administrators can change the <a href="settings.md#prevent-editing-approval-rules-in-merge-requests">merge request approvals settings</a>
to prevent users from overriding approval rules for merge requests.</p>
<h2>Require multiple approvals for a rule</h2>
<p>To create an approval rule which requires more than one approval:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you <a href="#add-an-approval-rule">create</a> or <a href="#edit-an-approval-rule">edit</a> a rule, set <strong>Approvals required</strong> to <code>2</code> or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>To require multiple approvals for a rule, you can also
<a href="../../../../api/merge_request_approvals.md#update-an-approval-rule-for-a-project">use the API</a>
to set the <code>approvals_required</code> attribute to <code>2</code> or more.</p>
<h2>Configure optional approval rules</h2>
<p>Merge request approvals can be optional for projects where approvals are
appreciated, but not required. To make an approval rule optional:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you <a href="#edit-an-approval-rule">create or edit a rule</a>, set <strong>Approvals required</strong> to <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make an approval rule optional, you can also use the API to
<a href="../../../../api/merge_request_approvals.md#update-an-approval-rule-for-a-project">update an approval rule for a project</a>,
and set the <code>approvals_required</code> attribute to <code>0</code>.</p>
<h2>Approvals for protected branches</h2>
<p>Approval rules are often relevant only to specific branches, like your
<a href="../../repository/branches/default.html">default branch</a>. To configure an
approval rule for certain branches:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#add-an-approval-rule">Create an approval rule</a>.</li>
<li>Go to your project and select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Merge request approvals</strong> section, scroll to <strong>Approval rules</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Target branch</strong>:</li>
<li>To apply the rule to all protected branches, select <strong>All protected branches</strong>.</li>
<li>To apply the rule to a specific branch, select it from the list.</li>
<li>To enable this configuration, follow
   <a href="../../repository/branches/protected.md#require-code-owner-approval">Require Code Owner approval on a protected branch</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enable approval permissions for additional users</h2>
<p>Before users with the Planner or Reporter role can merge to a protected branch, you have to grant them
permission to approve merge requests.
Some users (like managers) might not need permission to push or merge code, but still need
oversight on proposed work.</p>
<p>Users with the Planner or Reporter role can approve merge requests only through regular approval rules.
Code owner approval rules require users to have at least the Developer role. For more information,
see <a href="#eligible-approvers">Eligible approvers</a>.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must select a specific branch, as this method does not work with <code>All Branches</code> or <code>All protected branches</code> settings.</li>
<li>The shared group must be added to an approval rule and not individual users, even when the added user is part of the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable approval permissions for these users without granting them push access:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../repository/branches/protected.html">Create a protected branch</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../group/_index.md#create-a-group">Create a new group</a> for the users with the
   Planner or Reporter role that need approval permissions.</li>
<li><a href="../../../group/_index.md#add-users-to-a-group">Add the users to the group</a>.
   The users must have at least the Planner role.</li>
<li><a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#invite-a-group-to-a-project">Share the project with your group</a>,
   with at least the Reporter role.</li>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Merge request approvals</strong> section, in the <strong>Approval rules</strong> section:</li>
<li>For a new rule, select <strong>Add approval rule</strong> and target the protected branch.</li>
<li>For an existing rule, select <strong>Edit</strong> and target the protected branch.</li>
<li>On the right sidebar, in <strong>Add approvers</strong>, select the group you created.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Security Approvals</h2>

<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Bot comment for approvals <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/411656">introduced</a> in GitLab 16.2 <a href="../../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.html">with a flag</a> named <code>security_policy_approval_notification</code>. Enabled by default.</li>
<li>Bot comment for approvals <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/130827">generally available</a> in GitLab 16.3. Feature flag <code>security_policy_approval_notification</code> removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>You can use <a href="../../../application_security/policies/merge_request_approval_policies.md#merge-request-approval-policy-editor">merge request approval policies</a> to define security approvals based on the status of vulnerabilities in the merge request and the default branch.
Details for each security policy is shown in the Security Approvals section of your Merge Request configuration.</p>
<p>The security approval rules are applied to all merge requests until the pipeline is complete. The application of the
security approval rules prevents users from merging in code before the security scans run. After the pipeline is
complete, the security approval rules are checked to determine if the security approvals are still required.
In case the scanners in the pipeline identify an issue and security approvals are required, a bot comment is generated
on the merge request to indicate which steps are needed to proceed.</p>
<p><img alt="Security Approvals" src="img/security_approvals_v15_0.png" /></p>
<p>These policies are both created and edited in the <a href="../../../application_security/policies/_index.md#policy-editor">security policy editor</a>.</p>
<h2>Eligible approvers</h2>
<p>To be eligible as an approver for your project, a user must be a direct member of at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your project.</li>
<li>Your project's group.</li>
<li>Any of your project's group's parent groups.</li>
<li>Another group that has been <a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#sharing-projects">shared with your project</a>.</li>
<li>Another group that has been <a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#sharing-groups">shared with your project's group or any of the group's parents</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="#group-approvers">group added as approvers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users with the Developer role can approve merge requests if one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users added as approvers at the project or merge request level.</li>
<li>Users who are <a href="#code-owners-as-approvers">Code owners</a> of the files
  changed in the merge request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users with the Planner or Reporter role can approve only if all of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The users are part of a group that has been <a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.html">shared</a> with the project.
  The group must have at least the Reporter role.</li>
<li>Approval permissions for users with the Planner and Reporter role <a href="#enable-approval-permissions-for-additional-users">are enabled</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To show who has participated in the merge request review, the Approvals widget in
a merge request displays a <strong>Commented by</strong> column. This column lists eligible approvers
who commented on the merge request. It helps authors and reviewers identify who to
contact with questions about the merge request's content.</p>
<p>If the number of required approvals is greater than the number of assigned approvers,
approvals from other users with at least the Developer role
in the project count toward meeting the required number of approvals, even if the
users were not explicitly listed in the approval rules.</p>
<h3>Code owners as approvers</h3>
<p>If you add <a href="../../codeowners/_index.html">code owners</a> to your repository, the owners of files
become eligible approvers in the project. To enable this merge request approval rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top bar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your project.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Merge requests</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Merge request approvals</strong> section, in the <strong>Approval rules</strong> section, locate the <strong>All eligible users</strong> rule.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Approvals required</strong> column, enter the number of approvals required.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also
<a href="../../repository/branches/protected.md#require-code-owner-approval">require code owner approval</a>
for protected branches.</p>
<h3>Approver by membership type</h3>
<p>The following tables show how membership type affects eligibility for both approval rules and
Code Owners.</p>
<h4>User eligibility</h4>
<p>When you assign individual users as approvers for approval rules or reference users in <code>CODEOWNERS</code>
files, like <code>@username</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Membership type</th>
<th>Approval rules</th>
<th>Code Owners</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Direct member of the project</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>

<td>{{&lt; no &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; no &gt;}}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Group eligibility</h4>
<p>When you assign groups as approvers for approval rules or reference groups in <code>CODEOWNERS</code> files,
like <code>@group-name</code>, only direct members of eligible groups can provide approvals:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Group type</th>
<th>Approval rules</th>
<th>Code Owners</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#sharing-projects">Groups invited to the project</a></td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#sharing-groups">Groups invited to the project's group</a></td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; no &gt;}}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Groups invited to a parent of the project's group</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; no &gt;}}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The project's group</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A parent of the project's group</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
<td>{{&lt; yes &gt;}}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>For group-based approvals, only direct members of the group can approve merge requests.
Inherited members of the eligible groups cannot provide approvals.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<h3>Group approvers</h3>
<p>You can add a group of users as approvers. All direct members of this group
can approve the rule. Inherited members cannot approve the rule.</p>
<p>Typically the group is a subgroup in your top-level namespace, unless you are
collaborating with an external group. If you are collaborating with another group
and want to use members of that group as approvers, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#sharing-projects">Share access to the project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../members/sharing_projects_groups.md#sharing-groups">Share access to your project's group</a>,
  which gives the external group approval access to all projects in your project's group.</li>
</ul>
<p>A user's membership in an approver group determines their individual approval permissions
in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherited members are not considered approvers. Only direct members can approve merge requests.</li>
<li>A user from a group approver group who is later also added as an individual approver
  counts as one approver, not two.</li>
<li>Merge request authors do not count as eligible approvers on their own merge requests by default.
  To change this behavior, disable the
  <a href="settings.md#prevent-approval-by-merge-request-creator"><strong>Prevent merge request creator approval</strong></a>
  project setting.</li>
<li>By default, committers to merge requests can approve a merge request. To change this behavior, enable
  the <a href="settings.md#prevent-approvals-by-users-who-add-commits"><strong>Prevent committers approval</strong></a>
  project setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Approval rule name can't be blank</h3>
<p>As a workaround for this validation error, you can delete the approval rule through
the API.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../../api/merge_request_approvals.md#list-all-approval-rules-for-a-project">List all approval rules for the project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../../api/merge_request_approvals.md#delete-an-approval-rule-for-a-project">DELETE the rule</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about this validation error, read
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285129">issue 285129</a>.</p>
<h3>Groups need explicit or inherited Developer role on a project</h3>
<p>A group created to handle approvals may be created in a different area of the
project hierarchy than the project requiring review. If this happens, members of the
group may not have permission to approve the merge request as they do not have access to it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>In the group structure below, project 1 belongs to subgroup 1 and subgroup 4 has users.</p>
<p><img alt="Example scenario - project and group hierarchy" src="img/group_access_example_01_v16_8.png" /></p>
<p>Project 1 has configured an approval rule for the project, which assigns subgroup 4 as approvers.
When a merge request is created, approvers from subgroup 4 appear in the eligible approvers list.
However, as users from subgroup 4 do not have permission to view the merge request, the <code>404</code> error is returned.
To grant membership, the group must be invited as a project member. It is now possible for users from subgroup 4 to approve.</p>
<p><img alt="Project members page showing subgroup 4 as a member" src="img/group_access_example_02_v16_8.png" /></p></code></pre>
