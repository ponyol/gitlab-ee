<p>GitLab Duo and SDLC trends measure the impact of GitLab Duo on software development lifecycle (SDLC) performance.
This dashboard provides visibility into key SDLC metrics in the context of AI adoption for projects or groups.
You can use the dashboard to measure which metrics have improved from your AI investments.</p>
<p>Use GitLab Duo and SDLC trends to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track SDLC trends in relation to your GitLab Duo journey: Examine how trends in GitLab Duo usage in a project or group influence other crucial productivity metrics such as mean time to merge and CI/CD statistics. GitLab Duo usage metrics are displayed for the last six months, including the current one.</li>
<li>Monitor GitLab Duo feature adoption: Track the use of seats and features in a project or group over the last 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assigned Duo seat engagement</strong>: Percentage of users that are assigned a GitLab Duo seat and used at least one AI feature in the last 30 days.
  It is calculated as the number of users with GitLab Duo seats that use AI features divided by the total number of assigned GitLab Duo seats.</li>
<li><strong>Code Suggestions usage</strong>: Percentage of users with assigned GitLab Duo seats that used Code Suggestions in the last 30 days.
  It is calculated as the number of unique users with GitLab Duo seats that interact with Code Suggestions divided by the total number of unique code contributors (users with <code>pushed</code> events) with GitLab Duo seats.
  For calculating Code Suggestions metrics, GitLab collects data only from code editor extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Code Suggestions acceptance rate</strong>: Percentage of code suggestions provided by GitLab Duo that have been accepted by code contributors in the last 30 days.
  It is calculated as the number of accepted code suggestions divided by the total number of generated code suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Duo Chat usage</strong>: Percentage of users that engage with GitLab Duo Chat every month.
  It is calculated as the number of monthly unique GitLab Duo Chat users divided by the total GitLab Duo assigned users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Metric trends</h2>
<p>The <strong>Metric trends</strong> table displays metrics for the last six months, with monthly values, percentage changes in the past six months, and trend sparklines.</p>
<h3>GitLab Duo usage metrics</h3>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Duo RCA usage <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/513252">introduced</a> in GitLab 18.1 <a href="../../administration/feature_flags/_index.html">with a flag</a> named <code>duo_rca_usage_rate</code>. Disabled by default.</li>
<li>Duo RCA usage <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/543987">enabled on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated</a> in GitLab 18.3.</li>
<li>Duo RCA usage <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/556726">generally available</a> in GitLab 18.4. Feature flag <code>duo_rca_usage_rate</code> removed.</li>
<li>Duo features usage <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/207562">introduced</a> in GitLab 18.6.</li>
<li>Duo Code Review requests and GitLab Duo Code Review comments <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/573979">introduced</a> in GitLab 18.7.</li>
<li>Duo Agent Platform chats and flows <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/583375">introduced</a> in GitLab 18.7.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Suggestions usage</strong>: Monthly user engagement with AI Code Suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<p>On GitLab.com, data updates every fives minutes.
  GitLab counts Code Suggestions usage only if the user has pushed code to the project in the current month.</p>
<p>The month-over-month comparison of the AI Usage unique users rate gives a more accurate indication Code Suggestion usage,
  because it eliminates factors such as developer experience level and project type or complexity.</p>
<p>The baseline for the AI Usage trend is the total number of code contributors, not only users with GitLab Duo seats.
  This baseline gives a more accurate representation of AI usage by team members.</p>
