<p>Merge request analytics provide DevOps managers with valuable insights into their team's code review and merging workflows.
Based on the detailed metrics and trends related to merge requests, organizations can monitor and optimize their development processes.</p>
<p>Use merge request analytics to view:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of merge requests your organization merged per month.</li>
<li>The average time between merge request creation and merge event.</li>
<li>Information about each merged merge request (such as milestone, commits, line changes, and assignees).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use merge request analytics to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low or high productivity months.</li>
<li>The efficiency and productivity of your merge request and code review processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These insights can help you make data-driven decisions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource allocation: Address low productivity periods by reallocating resources or adjusting timelines.</li>
<li>Performance benchmarking: Highlight high-performing teams and share best practices.</li>
<li>Milestone planning: Adjust timelines based on historical merging trends.</li>
<li>Process optimization: Identify and resolve bottlenecks in code review and merging workflows.</li>
</ul>
