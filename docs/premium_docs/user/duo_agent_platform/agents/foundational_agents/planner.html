<p>The Planner Agent is a specialized AI agent that assists with product management
and planning workflows in GitLab. It helps you create, prioritize, and track work more effectively
because it combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product management expertise.</li>
<li>Awareness of GitLab planning objects, like issues and epics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the Planner Agent when you need help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritization: Applying frameworks like RICE, MoSCoW, or WSJF to rank work items.</li>
<li>Work breakdown: Decomposing initiatives into epics, features, and user stories.</li>
<li>Create: Drafting memos or creating objects to provide value.</li>
<li>Dependency analysis: Identifying blocked work and understanding relationships between items.</li>
<li>Edit: Editing existing objects to save time and improve efficiency.</li>
<li>Planning sessions: Organizing sprints, milestones, or quarterly planning.</li>
<li>Status reporting: Generating summaries of progress, risks, and blockers.</li>
<li>Backlog management: Identifying stale issues, duplicates, or items needing refinement.</li>
<li>Estimation: Suggesting relative sizing or effort estimates for work items.</li>
</ul>
