<p>Epic boards build on the existing <a href="_index.html">epic tracking functionality</a> and
<a href="../../project/labels.html">labels</a>. Your epics appear as cards in vertical lists, organized by their assigned
labels.</p>
<p>On the top of each list, you can see the number of epics in the list ({{&lt; icon name="epic" &gt;}}) and the total weight of all its epics ({{&lt; icon name="weight" &gt;}}).</p>

<h3>Create a new list</h3>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a list between existing lists <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/462515">introduced</a> in GitLab 17.5.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Planner role for a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new list:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the left sidebar, select <strong>Search or go to</strong> and find your group. If you've <a href="../../interface_redesign.html">turned on the new navigation</a>, this field is on the top bar.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Plan</strong> &gt; <strong>Epic boards</strong>.</li>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>New list</strong>.</li>
<li>Hover or move keyboard focus between two lists.</li>
<li>Select <strong>New list</strong>.
   The new list panel opens.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="creating a new list between two lists in an issue board" src="img/issue_board_add_list_between_lists_v17_6.png" />
1. In the <strong>New list</strong> column expand the <strong>Select a label</strong> dropdown list and select the label to use as
   list scope.
1. Select <strong>Add to board</strong>.</p>
<p>The new list is inserted in the same position on the board as the new list panel.</p>
<p>To move and reorder lists, drag them around.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can select the <strong>New list</strong> at the right end of the board.
The new list is inserted at the right end of the lists, before <strong>Closed</strong>.</p>
<h3>Remove a list</h3>
<p>Removing a list doesn't have any effect on epics and labels, as it's just the
list view that's removed. You can always create it again later if you need.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Planner role for a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove a list from an epic board:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top of the list you want to remove, select the <strong>List settings</strong> icon ({{&lt; icon name="settings" &gt;}}).
   The list settings sidebar opens on the right.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Remove list</strong>.</li>
<li>On the confirmation dialog, select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create an epic from an epic board</h3>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Planner role for a group.</li>
<li>You must have <a href="#create-a-new-list">created a list</a> first.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create an epic from a list in epic board:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top of a list, select the <strong>New epic</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="plus" &gt;}}) icon.</li>
<li>Enter the new epic's title.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create epic</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Create a GitLab epic from an epic board" src="img/epic_board_epic_create_v15_10.png" /></p>
<h3>Edit an epic</h3>
<p>When you select an epic card from the epic board, the <a href="manage_epics.md#open-epics-in-a-drawer">epic opens in a drawer</a>.
There, you can edit all the fields, including the description, comments, or related items.</p>
<h3>Filter epics</h3>
<p>Use the filters on top of your epic board to show only
the results you want. It's similar to the filtering used in the epic list,
as the metadata from the epics and labels is re-used in the epic board.</p>
<p>You can filter by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author</li>
<li>Label</li>
</ul>
<h3>View count of issues, weight, and progress of an epic</h3>
<p>Epics on an epic board show a summary of their issues, weight, and progress.
To see the number of open and closed issues and the completed and incomplete
weight, hover over the issues icon {{&lt; icon name="issues" &gt;}}, weight icon {{&lt; icon name="weight" &gt;}}, or
progress icon {{&lt; icon name="progress" &gt;}}.</p>
<h3>Move epics and lists</h3>
<p>You can move epics and lists by dragging them.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Planner role for a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move an epic, select the epic card and drag it to another position in its current list or
into another list. Learn about possible effects in <a href="#dragging-epics-between-lists">Dragging epics between lists</a>.</p>
<p>To move a list, select its top bar, and drag it horizontally.
You can't move the <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Closed</strong> lists, but you can hide them when editing an epic board.</p>
<h4>Move an epic to the start of the list</h4>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367473">Introduced</a> in GitLab 15.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you have many epics, it's inconvenient to manually drag an epic from the bottom of a board list all
the way to the top. You can move epics to the top of the list with a menu shortcut.</p>
<p>Your epic is moved to the top of the list even if other epics are hidden by a filter.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must at least have the Planner role for a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move an epic to the start of the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>In an epic board, hover over the card of the epic you want to move.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Card options</strong> ({{&lt; icon name="ellipsis_v" &gt;}}), then <strong>Move to start of list</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Move an epic to the end of the list</h4>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367473">Introduced</a> in GitLab 15.4.</li>

</ol>
<h4>Dragging epics between lists</h4>
<p>When you drag epics between lists, the result is different depending on the source list
and the target list.</p>
