<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you create a project, you can <a href="../project/_index.html">choose from a list of templates</a>.
These templates, for things like GitLab Pages or Ruby, populate the new project with a copy of the files contained in the
template. This information is identical to the information used by <a href="../project/settings/import_export.html">GitLab project import/export</a>
and can help you start a new project more quickly.</p>
<p>You can <a href="../project/_index.html">customize the list</a> of available templates, so
that all projects in your group have the same list. To do this, you populate a subgroup with the projects you want to
use as templates.</p>
<p>You can also configure <a href="../../administration/custom_project_templates.html">custom templates for the instance</a>.</p>
<h2>Set up project templates for a group</h2>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have the Owner role for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up custom project templates in a group, add the subgroup that contains the
project templates to the group settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the group, create a <a href="subgroups/_index.html">subgroup</a>.</li>
<li><a href="_index.md#add-projects-to-a-group">Add projects to the new subgroup</a> as your templates.</li>
<li>In the left menu for the group, select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong>.</li>
<li>Expand <strong>Custom project templates</strong> and select the subgroup.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next time a group member creates a project, they can select any of the projects in the subgroup.</p>
<p>Projects in nested subgroups are not included in the template list.</p>
<h2>Which projects are available as templates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Public and internal projects can be selected by any authenticated user as a template for a new project,
  if all <a href="../project/settings/_index.md#configure-project-features-and-permissions">project features</a>
  except for <strong>GitLab Pages</strong> and <strong>Security and compliance</strong> are set to <strong>Everyone With Access</strong>.</li>
<li>Private projects can be selected only by users who are members of the projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/480779">known issue</a> exists:
<a href="../project/members/_index.md#membership-types">Inherited members</a> can't select project templates,
unless the <code>project_templates_without_min_access</code> feature flag is enabled.
This feature flag <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/480779">is disabled</a>
on GitLab.com, and so users must be granted direct membership of the template project.</p>
<h2>Example structure</h2>
<p>Here's a sample group and project structure for project templates, for <code>myorganization</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># GitLab instance and group
gitlab.com/myorganization/
    # Subgroups
    internal
    tools
    # Subgroup for handling project templates
    websites
        templates
            # Project templates
            client-site-django
            client-site-gatsby
            client-site-html

        # Other projects
        client-site-a
        client-site-b
        client-site-c
        ...
</code></pre>
<h2>What is copied from the templates</h2>
<p>When you create a project from a template, all exportable project items are copied from the template
to the new project. These items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repository branches, commits, and tags.</li>
<li>Project uploads.</li>
<li>Project configuration.</li>
<li>Issues and merge requests with their comments and other metadata.</li>
<li>Labels, milestones, snippets, and releases.</li>
<li>CI/CD pipeline configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list of what is copied, see <a href="../project/settings/import_export.md#project-items-that-are-exported">Project items that are exported</a>.</p>
<h3>Permissions and sensitive data</h3>
<p>The copying behavior might differ based on your permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have the Owner role for the project that contains the custom templates for the instance or if you're a GitLab administrator:
  all project settings, including project members, are copied over to the new project.</li>
<li>If you do not have the Owner role for the project or if you're not a GitLab administrator:
  project deploy keys and project webhooks are not copied over because they contain sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User assignments in templates</h2>
<p>When you use a template created by another user, any items that were assigned
to a user in the template are reassigned to you. It's important to understand
this reassignment when you configure security features like protected branches
and tags. For example, if the template contains a protected branch:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the template, the branch allows the template owner to merge into the default branch.</li>
<li>In the project created from the template, the branch allows you to merge into
  the default branch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Administrator cannot see custom project templates for the group when creating a project</h3>
<p>Custom project templates for a group are available only to group members.
If the administrator account you are using is not a member of a group,
you can't access the templates.</p></code></pre>
