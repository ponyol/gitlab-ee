<p>Value stream analytics calculates the duration of every stage of your software development process.
You can measure how much time it takes to go from an idea to production by tracking merge request or issue events.</p>
<p>Use value stream analytics to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of time it takes to go from an idea to production.</li>
<li>The velocity of a given project.</li>
<li>Bottlenecks in the development process.</li>
<li>Long-running issues or merge requests.</li>
<li>Factors that cause your software development lifecycle to slow down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Value stream analytics helps businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize their end-to-end DevSecOps workstreams.</li>
<li>Identify and solve inefficiencies.</li>
<li>Optimize their workstreams to deliver more value, faster (for example, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/02/20/how-we-reduced-mr-review-time-with-value-stream-management/">reducing merge request review time</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a click-through demo, see <a href="https://gitlab.navattic.com/vsm">the Value Stream Management product tour</a>.</p>
<p>Value stream analytics has a hierarchical structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>value stream</strong> contains a value stream stage list.</li>
<li>Each value stream stage list contains one or more <strong>stages</strong>.</li>
<li>Each stage is defined by two <strong>events</strong>: start and end.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Value streams</h2>
<p>A value stream is the entire work process that delivers value to customers.
Value streams are container objects for stages.
You can have multiple value streams per group, to focus on different aspects of the DevOps lifecycle.</p>
<h2>Value stream stages</h2>
<p>A stage represents an event pair (start and end events) with additional metadata, such as the name of the stage.
You can use value stream analytics with the built-in default stages, which you can reorder and hide.
You can also create and add custom stages that align with your specific development workflows.</p>
<h2>Value stream stage events</h2>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge request first reviewer assigned event <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/466383">introduced</a> in GitLab 17.2. Reviewer assignment events in merge requests created or updated prior to GitLab 17.2 are not available for reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>Events are the building blocks that define when stages start and end.
Each event has a start and end time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start event time marks when work begins in a stage (for example, when an issue is created).</li>
<li>End event time marks when work completes in a stage (for example, when an issue is closed).</li>
</ul>
<p>GitLab calculates stage duration based on the start and end event times, using this formula:
Stage duration = End event time - Start event time</p>
<p>Value stream analytics supports the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue closed</li>
<li>Issue created</li>
<li>Issue first added to a board</li>
<li>Issue first added to iteration</li>
<li>Issue first assigned</li>
<li>Issue first associated with a milestone</li>
<li>Issue first mentioned in a commit</li>
<li>Issue label added</li>
<li>Issue label removed</li>
<li>Merge request closed</li>
<li>Merge request created</li>
<li>Merge request first assigned</li>
<li>Merge request first committed</li>
<li>Merge request first deployed to production</li>
<li>Merge request label added</li>
<li>Merge request label removed</li>
<li>Merge request last approved</li>
<li>Merge request last build finished</li>
<li>Merge request last build started</li>
<li>Merge request merged</li>
<li>Merge request reviewer first assigned</li>
</ul>

<p>Value stream analytics uses a backend process to collect and aggregate stage-level data, which
ensures it can scale for large groups with a high number of issues and merge requests. Due to this process,
there may be a slight delay between when an action is taken (for example, closing an issue) and when the data
displays on the value stream analytics page.</p>
<p>It may take up to 10 minutes to process the data and display results. Data collection may take
longer than 10 minutes in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is the first time you are viewing value stream analytics and have not yet created a value stream.</li>
<li>If the group hierarchy has been re-arranged.</li>
<li>If there have been bulk updates on issues and merge requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>To view when the data was most recently updated, in the right corner next to <strong>Edit</strong>, hover over the <strong>Last updated</strong> badge.</p>
<h2>Stage measurement</h2>
<p>Value stream analytics measures each stage from its start event to its end event.
Only items that have reached their end event are included in the stage time calculation.</p>
<p>By default, blocked issues are not included in the lifecycle overview.
However, you can use custom labels (for example <code>workflow::blocked</code>) to track them.</p>
<p>You can customize stages in value stream analytics based on pre-defined events.
To help you with the configuration, GitLab provides a pre-defined list of stages that you can use as a template.
For example, you can define a stage that starts when you add a label to an issue,
and ends when you add another label.</p>
<p>The following table gives an overview of the pre-defined stages in value stream analytics.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>Measurement method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Issue</td>
<td>The median time between creating an issue and taking action to solve it, by either labeling it or adding it to a milestone, whichever comes first. The label is tracked only if it already has an <a href="../../project/issue_board.html">issue board list</a> created for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plan</td>
<td>The median time between the action you took for the previous stage, and pushing the first commit to the branch. The first commit on the branch triggers the separation between <strong>Plan</strong> and <strong>Code</strong>. At least one of the commits in the branch must contain the related issue number (for example, <code>#42</code>). If none of the commits in the branch mention the related issue number, it is not considered in the measurement time of the stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Code</td>
<td>The median time between pushing a first commit (previous stage) and creating a merge request (MR) related to that commit. The key to keep the process tracked is to include the <a href="../../project/issues/managing_issues.md#default-closing-pattern">issue closing pattern</a> in the description of the merge request. For example, <code>Closes #xxx</code>, where <code>xxx</code> is the number of the issue related to this merge request. If the closing pattern is not present, then the calculation uses the creation time of the first commit in the merge request as the start time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test</td>
<td>The median time to run the entire pipeline for that project. It's related to the time GitLab CI/CD takes to run every job for the commits pushed to that merge request. It is basically the start-&gt;finish time for all pipelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Review</td>
<td>The median time taken to review a merge request that has a closing issue pattern, between its creation and until it's merged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Staging</td>
<td>The median time between merging a merge request that has a closing issue pattern until the very first deployment to a <a href="#production-environment">production environment</a>. If there isn't a production environment, this is not tracked.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Value stream analytics works on timestamp data and aggregates only the final start and stop events of the stage. For items that move back and forth between stages multiple times, the stage time is calculated solely from the final events' timestamps.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<h3>Example workflow</h3>
<p>This example shows a workflow through all seven stages in one day.</p>
<p>If a stage does not include a start and a stop time, its data is not included in the median time.
In this example, milestones have been created and CI/CD for testing and setting environments is configured.</p>
<ul>
<li>09:00: Create issue. <strong>Issue</strong> stage starts.</li>
<li>11:00: Add issue to a milestone (or backlog), start work on the issue, and create a branch locally.
  <strong>Issue</strong> stage stops and <strong>Plan</strong> stage starts.</li>
<li>12:00: Make the first commit.</li>
<li>12:30: Make the second commit to the branch that mentions the issue number.
  <strong>Plan</strong> stage stops and <strong>Code</strong> stage starts.</li>
<li>14:00: Push branch and create a merge request that contains the
  <a href="../../project/issues/managing_issues.md#closing-issues-automatically">issue closing pattern</a>.
  <strong>Code</strong> stage stops and <strong>Test</strong> and <strong>Review</strong> stages start.</li>
<li>GitLab CI/CD takes 5 minutes to run scripts defined in the <a href="../../../ci/yaml/_index.html"><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file</a>.</li>
<li>19:00: Merge the merge request. <strong>Review</strong> stage stops and <strong>Staging</strong> stage starts.</li>
<li>19:30: Deployment to the <code>production</code> environment finishes. <strong>Staging</strong> stops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Value stream analytics records the following times for each stage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue</strong>: 09:00 to 11:00: 2 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>: 11:00 to 12:00: 1 hr</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>: 12:00 to 14:00: 2 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>: 5 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: 14:00 to 19:00: 5 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Staging</strong>: 19:00 to 19:30: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind the following observations related to this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>This example demonstrates that it doesn't matter if your first
  commit doesn't mention the issue number, you can do this later in any commit
  on the branch you are working on.</li>
<li>The <strong>Test</strong> stage is used in the calculation for the overall time of
  the cycle. It is included in the <strong>Review</strong> process, as every MR should be
  tested.</li>
<li>This example illustrates only <strong>one cycle</strong> of the seven stages. The value stream analytics dashboard
  shows the median time for multiple cycles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cumulative label event duration</h3>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/432576">Introduced</a> in GitLab 16.9 <a href="../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.html">with flags</a> named <code>enable_vsa_cumulative_label_duration_calculation</code> and <code>vsa_duration_from_db</code>. Disabled by default.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/17476">Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed</a> in GitLab 16.10. Feature flag <code>vsa_duration_from_db</code> removed.</li>
<li>Feature flag <code>enable_vsa_cumulative_label_duration_calculation</code> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/17478">removed</a> in GitLab 17.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>With this feature, value stream analytics measures the duration of repetitive events for label-based stages. You should configure label removal or addition events for both start and end events.</p>
<p>For example, a stage tracks when the <code>in progress</code> label is added and removed, with the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li>9:00: label added.</li>
<li>10:00: label removed.</li>
<li>12:00: label added.</li>
<li>14:00 label removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the original calculation method, the duration is five hours (from 9:00 to 14:00).
With cumulative label event duration calculation enabled, the duration is three hours (9:00 to 10:00 and 12:00 to 14:00).</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>When you upgrade your GitLab version to 16.10 (or to a higher version), existing label-based value stream analytics stages are automatically reaggregated using the background aggregation process.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<h4>Reaggregate data after upgrade</h4>
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering: GitLab Self-Managed</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>On large instances, when you upgrade the GitLab version and especially if several minor versions are skipped, the background aggregation processes might last longer. This delay can result in outdated data on the Value Stream Analytics page.
To speed up the aggregation process and avoid outdated data, in the <a href="../../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session">rails console</a> you can invoke the synchronous aggregation snippet for a given group:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">group = Group.find(-1) # put your group id here
group_to_aggregate = group.root_ancestor

loop do
  cursor = {}
  context = Analytics::CycleAnalytics::AggregationContext.new(cursor: cursor)
  service_response = Analytics::CycleAnalytics::DataLoaderService.new(group: group_to_aggregate, model: Issue, context: context).execute

  if service_response.success? &amp;&amp; service_response.payload[:reason] == :limit_reached
    cursor = service_response.payload[:context].cursor
  elsif service_response.success?
    puts &quot;finished&quot;
    break
  else
    puts &quot;failed&quot;
    break
  end
end

loop do
  cursor = {}
  context = Analytics::CycleAnalytics::AggregationContext.new(cursor: cursor)
  service_response = Analytics::CycleAnalytics::DataLoaderService.new(group: group_to_aggregate, model: MergeRequest, context: context).execute

  if service_response.success? &amp;&amp; service_response.payload[:reason] == :limit_reached
    cursor = service_response.payload[:context].cursor
  elsif service_response.success?
    puts &quot;finished&quot;
    break
  else
    puts &quot;failed&quot;
    break
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h2>Production environment</h2>
<p>Value stream analytics identifies <a href="../../../ci/environments/_index.md#deployment-tier-of-environments">production environments</a> by looking for project
<a href="../../../ci/yaml/_index.md#environment">environments</a> with a name matching any of these patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prod</code> or <code>prod/*</code></li>
<li><code>production</code> or <code>production/*</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These patterns are not case-sensitive.</p>
<p>You can change the name of a project environment in your GitLab CI/CD configuration.</p>

<h2>Value stream analytics metrics</h2>
<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> page in value stream analytics displays key metrics of the DevSecOps lifecycle performance for projects and groups.</p>
<h3>Lifecycle metrics</h3>
<p>Value stream analytics includes the following lifecycle metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead time</strong>: Median time from when the issue was created to when it was closed.</li>
<li><strong>Cycle time</strong>: Median time between when an issue is first <a href="../../project/issues/crosslinking_issues.md#from-commit-messages">referenced in the commit message</a> of a merge request and when that referenced issue is closed. You must include <code>#</code> followed by the issue number (for example, <code>#123</code>) in the commit message, otherwise no data is displayed. Cycle time is typically shorter than lead time because the merge request is created after the first commit.</li>
<li><strong>New issues</strong>: Number of new issues created.</li>
<li><strong>Deploys</strong>: Total number of deployments to production.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DORA metrics</h3>

<h2>Label-based stages for custom value streams</h2>
<p>To measure complex workflows, you can use <a href="../../project/labels.md#scoped-labels">scoped labels</a>. For example, to measure deployment
time from a staging environment to production, you could use the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the code is deployed to staging, the <code>workflow::staging</code> label is added to the merge request.</li>
<li>When the code is deployed to production, the <code>workflow::production</code> label is added to the merge request.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Label-based value stream analytics stage" src="img/vsa_label_based_stage_v14_0.png" title="Creating a label-based value stream analytics stage" /></p>
<h3>Automatic data labeling with webhooks</h3>
<p>You can automatically add labels by using <a href="../../project/integrations/webhook_events.html">GitLab webhook events</a>,
so that a label is applied to merge requests or issues when a specific event occurs.
Then, you can add label-based stages to track your workflow.
To learn more about the implementation, see the blog post <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/08/19/applying-gitlab-labels-automatically/">Applying GitLab Labels Automatically</a>.</p>
<h3>Example configuration</h3>
<p><img alt="Example configuration" src="img/object_hierarchy_v14_10.png" title="Example custom value stream configuration" /></p>
<p>In the previous example, two independent value streams are set up for two teams that are using different development workflows in the <strong>Test Group</strong> (top-level namespace).</p>
<p>The first value stream uses standard timestamp-based events for defining the stages. The second value stream uses label events.</p>

<h2>Value Stream Analytics GraphQL API</h2>
<p>{{&lt; details &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate</li>
<li>Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /details &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading stage metrics through GraphQL <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410327">introduced</a> in GitLab 17.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>With the VSA GraphQL API, you can request metrics from your configured value streams and value stream stages. This can be useful if you want to export VSA data to an external system or for a report.</p>
<p>The following metrics are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of completed items in the stage. The count is limited to a maximum of 10,000 items.</li>
<li>Median duration for the completed items in the stage.</li>
<li>Average duration for the completed items in the stage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Request the metrics</h3>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least the Reporter role.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, you must determine which value stream you want to use in the reporting.</p>
<p>To request the configured value streams for a group, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">group(fullPath: &quot;your-group-path&quot;) {
  valueStreams {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, to request metrics for a project, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphl">project(fullPath: &quot;your-project-path&quot;) {
  valueStreams {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To request metrics for stages of a value stream, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">group(fullPath: &quot;your-group-path&quot;) {
  valueStreams(id: &quot;your-value-stream-id&quot;) {
    nodes {
      stages {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Depending how you want to consume the data, you can request metrics for one specific stage or all stages in your value stream.</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Requesting metrics for all stages might be too slow for some installations.
The recommended approach is to request metrics stage by stage.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>Requesting metrics for the stage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">group(fullPath: &quot;your-group-path&quot;) {
  valueStreams(id: &quot;your-value-stream-id&quot;) {
    nodes {
      stages(id: &quot;your-stage-id&quot;) {
        id
        name
        metrics(timeframe: { start: &quot;2024-03-01&quot;, end: &quot;2024-03-31&quot; }) {
          average {
            value
            unit
          }
          median {
            value
            unit
          }
          count {
            value
            unit
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>You should always request metrics with a given time frame.
The longest supported time frame is 180 days.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>The <code>metrics</code> node supports additional filtering options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignee usernames</li>
<li>Author username</li>
<li>Label names</li>
<li>Milestone title</li>
</ul>
<p>Example request with filters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">group(fullPath: &quot;your-group-path&quot;) {
  valueStreams(id: &quot;your-value-stream-id&quot;) {
    nodes {
      stages(id: &quot;your-stage-id&quot;) {
        id
        name
        metrics(
          labelNames: [&quot;backend&quot;],
          milestoneTitle: &quot;17.0&quot;,
          timeframe: { start: &quot;2024-03-01&quot;, end: &quot;2024-03-31&quot; }
        ) {
          average {
            value
            unit
          }
          median {
            value
            unit
          }
          count {
            value
            unit
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Best practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>To get an accurate view of the current status, request metrics as close to the end of the time frame as possible.</li>
<li>For periodic reporting, you can create a script and use the <a href="../../../ci/pipelines/schedules.html">scheduled pipelines</a> feature to export the data in a timely manner.</li>
<li>When invoking the API, you get the current data from the database. Over time, the same metrics might change due to changes in the underlying data in the database. For example, moving or removing a project from the group might affect group-level metrics.</li>
<li>Re-requesting the metrics for previous periods and comparing them to the previously collected metrics can show skews in the data, which can help in discovering and explaining changing trends.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feature availability</h2>
<p>Value stream analytics offers different features at the project and group level for FOSS and licensed versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>On GitLab Free, value stream analytics does not aggregate data. It queries the database directly where the date range filter is applied to the creation date of issues and merge request. You can view value stream analytics with pre-defined default stages.</li>
<li>On GitLab Premium, value stream analytics aggregates data and applies the date range filter on the end event. You can also create, edit, and delete value streams.</li>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>100% CPU utilization by Sidekiq <code>cronjob:analytics_cycle_analytics</code></h3>
<p>It is possible that value stream analytics background jobs
strongly impact performance by monopolizing CPU resources.</p>
<p>To recover from this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable the feature for all projects in <a href="../../../administration/operations/rails_console.html">the Rails console</a>,
   and remove existing jobs:</li>
</ol>
<p>```ruby
   Project.find_each do |p|
     p.analytics_access_level='disabled';
     p.save!
   end</p>
<p>Analytics::CycleAnalytics::GroupStage.delete_all
   Analytics::CycleAnalytics::Aggregation.delete_all
   ```</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure a <a href="../../../administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html">Sidekiq routing</a>
   with for example a single <code>feature_category=value_stream_management</code>
   and multiple <code>feature_category!=value_stream_management</code> entries.
   Find other relevant queue metadata in the
   <a href="../../../administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.md#list-of-available-job-classes">Enterprise Edition list</a>.</li>
<li>Enable value stream analytics for one project after another.
   You might need to tweak the Sidekiq routing further according to your performance requirements.</li>
</ol></code></pre>
