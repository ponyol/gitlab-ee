<p>This page contains upgrade information for minor and patch versions of GitLab 16.
Ensure you review these instructions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your installation type.</li>
<li>All versions between your current version and your target version.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional information for Helm chart installations, see
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/7_0.html">the Helm chart 7.0 upgrade notes</a>.</p>
<h2>Issues to be aware of when upgrading from 15.11</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../deprecations.md#postgresql-12-deprecated">PostgreSQL 12 is not supported starting from GitLab 16</a>. Upgrade PostgreSQL to at least version 13.6 before upgrading to GitLab 16.0 or later.</li>
<li>If your GitLab instance upgraded first to 15.11.0, 15.11.1, or 15.11.2 the database schema is incorrect.
  Perform the <a href="#undefined-column-error-upgrading-to-162-or-later">workaround</a> before upgrading to 16.x.</li>
<li>Starting with 16.0, GitLab Self-Managed installations now have two database connections by default, instead of one. This change doubles the number of PostgreSQL connections. It makes self-managed versions of GitLab behave similarly to GitLab.com, and is a step toward enabling a separate database for CI features for self-managed versions of GitLab. Before upgrading to 16.0, determine if you need to <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#configuring-multiple-database-connections">increase max connections for PostgreSQL</a>.</li>
<li>This change applies to installation methods with Linux packages (Omnibus), GitLab Helm chart, GitLab Operator, GitLab Docker images, and self-compiled installations.</li>
<li><a href="#disable-the-second-database-connection">The second database connection can be disabled</a>.</li>
<li>Most installations can skip 16.0, 16.1, and 16.2, as the first required stop on the upgrade path is 16.3.
  In all cases, you should review the notes for those intermediate versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some GitLab installations must stop at those intermediate versions depending on which features are used
  and the size of the environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>16.0.8: Instances with lots of records in the users table.
    For more information, see <a href="#long-running-user-type-data-change">long-running user type data change</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#1610">16.1.5</a>: Instances that use the NPM package registry.</li>
<li><a href="#1620">16.2.8</a>: Instances with lots of pipeline variables (including historical pipelines).</li>
</ul>
<p>If your instance is affected and you skip these stops:</p>
<ul>
<li>The upgrade can take hours to complete.</li>
<li>The instance generates 500 errors until all the database changes are finished, after which
    Puma and Sidekiq must restarted.</li>
<li>
<p>For Linux package installations, a timeout occurs and a
    <a href="../package/package_troubleshooting.md#error-command-timed-out-after-3600s">manual workaround to complete the migrations</a>
    is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitLab 16.0 introduced changes around enforcing limits on project sizes. On self-managed, if you use
  these limits, projects that have reached their limit causes error messages when pushing to unaffected Git
  repositories in the same group. The errors often refer to exceeding a limit of zero bytes (<code>limit of 0 B</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The pushes succeed, but the errors imply otherwise and might cause issues with automation.
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416646">Read more in the issue</a>.
  The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/131122">bug is fixed in GitLab 16.5 and later</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usually, backups in environments that have PgBouncer must <a href="../../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#bypassing-pgbouncer">bypass PgBouncer by setting variables that are prefixed with <code>GITLAB_BACKUP_</code></a>. However, due to an <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422163">issue</a>, <code>gitlab-backup</code> uses the regular database connection through PgBouncer instead of the direct connection defined in the override, and the database backup fails. The workaround is to use <code>pg_dump</code> directly.</p>

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gitaly and Praefect configuration structure must be changed before upgrading to GitLab 16.
  <strong>To avoid data loss</strong> reconfigure Praefect first, and as part of the new configuration, disable metadata verification.

<li>
<p><a href="#gitaly-configuration-structure-change">Gitaly configuration structure change</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you reconfigure Gitaly to store Git data in a location other than <code>/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories</code>,
  packaged GitLab 16.0 and later does not automatically create the directory structure.
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/8320">Read the issue for more details and the workaround</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>16.11.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/146881"><code>groups_direct</code> field was added</a>
  to the <a href="../../ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html">JSON web token (ID token)</a>.</li>
<li>If you use GitLab CI/CD ID tokens to authenticate with third party services,
    this change can cause the HTTP header size to increase. Proxy servers might reject
    the request if the headers get too big.</li>
<li>If possible, increase the header limit on the receiving system.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/467253">issue 467253</a> for more details.</li>
<li>After upgrading to GitLab 16.11 some users with large environments and databases experience
  timeouts loading source code pages in the web UI.</li>
<li>These timeouts are caused by slow PostgreSQL queries for pipeline data, which then
    exceed the internal 60 second timeout.</li>
<li>You can still clone Git repositories, and other requests for repository data works.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/472420">issue 472420</a> for more details,
    including steps to confirm you're affected and housekeeping to run in PostgreSQL to correct it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>In GitLab 16.11, PostgreSQL is automatically upgraded to 14.x except for the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are running the database in high availability using Patroni.</li>
<li>Your database nodes are part of a GitLab Geo configuration.</li>
<li>You have specifically <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#opt-out-of-automatic-postgresql-upgrades">opted out</a> from automatically upgrading PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>You have <code>postgresql['version'] = 13</code> in your <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fault-tolerant and Geo installations support manual upgrades to PostgreSQL 14,
see <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#packaged-postgresql-deployed-in-an-hageo-cluster">Packaged PostgreSQL deployed in an HA/Geo Cluster</a>.</p>
<h3>Geo installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to a bug introduced GitLab 16.5 and fixed in 17.0, <a href="../../administration/pages/_index.html">GitLab Pages</a> deployment files are being orphaned on secondary Geo sites. If Pages deployments are stored locally, then this can lead to zero remaining storage and subsequently data loss in the event of a failover.
  See details of the problem and workaround in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/457159">issue 457159</a>.</li>

<h2>16.10.0</h2>
<p>You might encounter the following error while upgrading to GitLab 16.10 or later:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:  column namespace_settings.delayed_project_removal does not exist
</code></pre>
<p>This error can occur when a migration that removes the column runs before a later migration runs that references the now-deleted column. A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/148135">fix</a> for this bug is planned for release in 16.11.</p>
<p>To workaround the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporarily re-create the column. Using <code>gitlab-psql</code> or connecting to the database manually, run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>sql
   ALTER TABLE namespace_settings ADD COLUMN delayed_project_removal BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL;</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Apply pending migrations:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Finalize checks:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   gitlab-ctl upgrade-check</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the column. Using <code>gitlab-psql</code> or connecting to the database manually, run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>sql
   ALTER TABLE namespace_settings DROP COLUMN delayed_project_removal;</code></p>
<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>Linux package installations for GitLab 16.10 include an upgrade to a new major version of Patroni, from version 2.1.0 to version 3.0.1.</p>
<p>If you're using one of the <a href="../../administration/reference_architectures/_index.html">reference architectures</a>
that enables <a href="../../administration/reference_architectures/_index.md#high-availability-ha">High Availability (HA)</a>
(3k users or more), you're using

<h3>Geo installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PostgreSQL version 14 is the default for fresh installations of GitLab 16.7 and later. Due to a known issue, existing Geo secondary
  sites cannot be upgraded to PostgreSQL version 14. For more information, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/7768#note_1652076255">issue 7768</a>.
  All Geo sites must run the same version of PostgreSQL. To add a new Geo secondary site on GitLab 16.7 to 16.8.1,
  you must take one of the following actions based on your configuration:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add your first Geo secondary site: <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server">Upgrade the Primary site to PostgreSQL 14</a>
    before you set up the new Geo secondary site. No special action is required if your primary site is already running PostgreSQL 14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add a new Geo secondary site to a deployment that already has one or more Geo secondaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>If all existing sites are running PostgreSQL 13, install the new Geo secondary site with <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#pin-the-packaged-postgresql-version-fresh-installs-only">pinned PostgreSQL version 13</a>.</li>
<li>If all existing sites are running PostgreSQL 14: No special action is required.</li>
<li>Upgrade all existing sites to GitLab 16.8.2 or later and PostgreSQL 14 before you add the new Geo secondary site to the deployment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to a bug introduced GitLab 16.5, <a href="../../user/snippets.html">personal snippets</a> are not being replicated to secondary Geo sites. This can lead to loss of personal snippet data in the event of a Geo failover.
  See details of the problem and workaround in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/439933">issue 439933</a>.</p>

<h2>16.7.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GitLab 16.7 is a required upgrade stop. This ensures that all database changes introduced
  in GitLab 16.7 and earlier have been implemented on all self-managed instances. Dependent changes can then be released
  in GitLab 16.8 and later. <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429611">Issue 429611</a> provides more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you skip 16.6 in your upgrade path, you might experience performance issues after upgrading to 16.7
    when your instance processes a background database migration from the GitLab 16.6 release.
    Read more about the <code>ci_builds</code> migration in the <a href="#1660">16.6.0 upgrade notes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, backups in environments that have PgBouncer must <a href="../../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#bypassing-pgbouncer">bypass PgBouncer by setting variables that are prefixed with <code>GITLAB_BACKUP_</code></a>. However, due to an <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422163">issue</a>, <code>gitlab-backup</code> uses the regular database connection through PgBouncer instead of the direct connection defined in the override, and the database backup fails. The workaround is to use <code>pg_dump</code> directly.</p>

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>Specific information applies to Linux package installations:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of GitLab 16.7, PostgreSQL 14 is the default version installed with the Linux package.
  During a package upgrade, the database isn't upgraded to PostgreSQL 14.
  If you want to upgrade to PostgreSQL 14, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server">you must do it manually</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use PostgreSQL 13, you must set <code>postgresql['version'] = 13</code> in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>.</p>
<h3>Geo installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PostgreSQL version 14 is the default for fresh installations of GitLab 16.7 and later. Due to a known issue, existing Geo secondary
  sites cannot be upgraded to PostgreSQL version 14. For more information, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/7768#note_1652076255">issue</a>.
  All Geo sites must run the same version of PostgreSQL. To add a new Geo secondary site based on GitLab 16.7 to 16.8.1, you must
  take one of the following actions based on your configuration:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are adding your first Geo secondary site: <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server">Upgrade the Primary site to PostgreSQL 14</a> before setting up the new Geo secondary site. No special action is required if your primary site is already running PostgreSQL 14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are adding a new Geo secondary site to a deployment that already has one or more Geo secondaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>If all existing sites are running PostgreSQL 13: Install the new Geo secondary site with <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#pin-the-packaged-postgresql-version-fresh-installs-only">pinned PostgreSQL version 13</a>.</li>
<li>If all existing sites are running PostgreSQL 14: No special action is required.</li>
<li>Upgrade all existing sites to GitLab 16.8.2 or later and PostgreSQL 14 before you add the new Geo secondary site to the deployment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might experience verification failures on a subset of projects due to checksum mismatch between the primary site and the secondary site. The details are tracked in this <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/427493">issue</a>. There is no risk of data loss as the data is being correctly replicated to the secondary sites. Users cloning impacted projects from a Geo secondary site will always be redirected to the primary site. There are no known workarounds at this time. We are actively working on a fix.</p>

<h2>16.6.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitLab 16.6 introduces a background migration that re-writes every row in the
  CI jobs table (<code>ci_builds</code>) as part of upgrading the primary key to 64 bits.
  <code>ci_builds</code> is one of the largest tables on most GitLab instances, so this
  migration runs more aggressively than usual to ensure it takes a reasonable amount of time.
  Background migrations usually pause between batches of rows, but this migration does not.</li>
</ul>
<p>This might cause performance issues in self-managed environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk I/O will be higher than usual. This will be a particular issue for instances
    hosted by cloud providers where disk I/O is restricted.</li>
<li>Autovacuum might run more frequently in the background to ensure the old
    rows (dead tuples) are removed, and to perform other related housekeeping.</li>
<li>Queries might run slowly, temporarily, because inefficient query plans get
    selected by PostgreSQL. This might be triggered by the volume of change on the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pause the running migration in the <a href="../background_migrations.md#from-the-gitlab-ui"><strong>Admin</strong> area</a>.</li>
<li>
<p>Recreate table statistics manually on the
    <a href="../../administration/troubleshooting/postgresql.md#start-a-database-console">database console</a>
    to ensure the right query plan is selected:</p>
<p><code>sql
SET statement_timeout = 0;
VACUUM FREEZE VERBOSE ANALYZE public.ci_builds;</code></p>
</li>

<h2>16.5.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Git 2.42.0 and later is required by Gitaly. For self-compiled installations, you should use the <a href="../../install/self_compiled/_index.md#git">Git version provided by Gitaly</a>.</li>
<li>A regression may sometimes cause an <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/431659">HTTP 500 error when navigating a group</a>. Upgrading to GitLab 16.6 or later resolves the issue.</li>

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>SSH clone URLs can be customized by setting <code>gitlab_rails['gitlab_ssh_host']</code>
  in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>. This setting must now be a
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/132238">valid hostname</a>.
  Previously, it could be an arbitrary string that was used to show a
  custom hostname and port in the repository clone URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, prior to GitLab 16.5, the following setting worked:</p>
<p><code>ruby
  gitlab_rails['gitlab_ssh_host'] = "gitlab.example.com:2222"</code></p>
<p>Starting with GitLab 16.5, the hostname and port must be specified separately:</p>
<p><code>ruby
  gitlab_rails['gitlab_ssh_host'] = "gitlab.example.com"
  gitlab_rails['gitlab_shell_ssh_port'] = 2222</code></p>
<p>After you change the setting, make sure to reconfigure GitLab:</p>
<p><code>shell
  sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
<h3>Geo installations</h3>

<p><code>sql
  -- replace `delete_branch_regex` with a name of the field used in constraint
  SELECT id FROM push_rules WHERE LENGTH(delete_branch_regex) &gt; 511;</code></p>
<p>To find out if a push rule belongs to a project, group, or instance, run this script
  in the <a href="../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session">Rails console</a>:</p>
<p><code>``ruby
  # replace</code>delete_branch_regex` with a name of the field used in constraint

<p>array = long_rules.map do |lr|

      "Push rule with ID #{lr.id} is configured in a project #{lr.project.full_name}"
    elsif lr.group
      "Push rule with ID #{lr.id} is configured in a group #{lr.group.full_name}"
    else
      "Push rule with ID #{lr.id} is configured on the instance level"
    end
  end</p>
<p>puts "Total long rules: #{array.count}"
  puts array.join("\n")
  ```</p>
<p>Reduce the value length of the regex field for affected push rules records, then
  retry the migration.</p>
<p>If you have too many affected push rules, and you can't update them through the GitLab UI,

<li>Usually, backups in environments that have PgBouncer must <a href="../../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#bypassing-pgbouncer">bypass PgBouncer by setting variables that are prefixed with <code>GITLAB_BACKUP_</code></a>. However, due to an <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422163">issue</a>, <code>gitlab-backup</code> uses the regular database connection through PgBouncer instead of the direct connection defined in the override, and the database backup fails.

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>Specific information applies to Linux package installations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In GitLab 16.0, we <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/05/22/gitlab-16-0-released/#omnibus-improvements">announced</a> an upgraded base Docker image,
  which has a new version of OpenSSH Server. An unintended consequence of the new version is that it disables accepting SSH RSA SHA-1 signatures by default. This issue should only
  impact users using very outdated SSH clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid problems with SHA-1 signatures being unavailable, users should update their SSH clients because using SHA-1 signatures is discouraged by the upstream library for security
  reasons.</p>
<p>To allow for a transition period where users can't immediately upgrade their SSH clients, GitLab 16.3 and later has support for a <code>GITLAB_ALLOW_SHA1_RSA</code> environment variable in
  the <code>Dockerfile</code>. If <code>GITLAB_ALLOW_SHA1_RSA</code> is set to <code>true</code>, this deprecated support is reactivated.</p>
<p>Because we want to foster security best practices and follow the upstream recommendation, this environment variable will only be available until GitLab 17.0, when we plan to
  drop support for it.</p>
<p>For more information, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.8">OpenSSH 8.8 release notes</a>.</li>

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>Specific information applies to Linux package installations:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of GitLab 16.2, PostgreSQL 13.11 and 14.8 are both shipped with the Linux package.
  During a package upgrade, the database isn't upgraded to PostgreSQL 14. If you
  want to upgrade to PostgreSQL 14, you must do it manually:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>shell
  sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade -V 14</code></p>
<p>PostgreSQL 14 isn't supported on Geo deployments and is <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9065">planned</a>
  for future releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 16.2, we are upgrading Redis from 6.2.11 to 7.0.12. This upgrade is expected to be fully backwards compatible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Redis is not automatically restarted as part of <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.
  Hence, users are manually required to run <code>sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis</code> after
  the reconfigure run so that the new Redis version gets used. A warning
  mentioning that the installed Redis version is different than the one running is
  displayed at the end of reconfigure run until the restart is performed.</p>
<p>Follow <a href="../zero_downtime.html">the zero-downtime instructions</a> for upgrading your Redis HA cluster.</p>
<h3>Self-compiled installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Git 2.41.0 and later is required by Gitaly. You should use the <a href="../../install/self_compiled/_index.md#git">Git version provided by Gitaly</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geo installations</h3>
<p>Specific information applies to installations using Geo:</p>
<ul>
<li>New job artifacts are not replicated by Geo if job artifacts are configured to be stored in object storage and <code>direct_upload</code> is enabled. This bug is fixed in GitLab versions 16.1.4,
  16.2.3, 16.3.0, and later.</li>
<li>Impacted versions: GitLab versions 16.1.0 - 16.1.3 and 16.2.0 - 16.2.2.</li>
<li>While running an affected version, artifacts which appeared to become synced may actually be missing on the secondary site.
    Affected artifacts are automatically resynced upon upgrade to 16.1.5, 16.2.5, 16.3.1, 16.4.0, or later.
    You can <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/419742#to-fix-data">manually resync affected job artifacts</a> if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cloning LFS objects from secondary site downloads from the primary site</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410413">bug</a> in the Geo proxying logic for LFS objects meant that all LFS clone requests against a secondary site are proxied to the primary even if the secondary site is up-to-date. This can result in increased load on the primary site and longer access times for LFS objects for users cloning from the secondary site.</p>
<p>In GitLab 15.1 proxying was enabled by default.</p>
<p>You are not impacted:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your installation is not configured to use LFS objects</li>
<li>If you do not use Geo to accelerate remote users</li>
<li>If you are using Geo to accelerate remote users but have disabled proxying</li>
</ul>

<p>Workaround: A possible workaround is to <a href="../../administration/geo/secondary_proxy/_index.md#disable-secondary-site-http-proxying">disable proxying</a>. The secondary site fail to serve LFS files that have not been replicated at the time of cloning.</p>
<h2>16.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <code>BackfillPreparedAtMergeRequests</code> background migration is finalized with
  the <code>FinalizeBackFillPreparedAtMergeRequests</code> post-deploy migration.
  GitLab 15.10.0 introduced a <a href="../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations">batched background migration</a> to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/111865">backfill <code>prepared_at</code> values on the <code>merge_requests</code> table</a>. This
  migration may take multiple days to complete on larger GitLab instances. Make sure the migration
  has completed successfully before upgrading to 16.1.0.</li>
<li>GitLab 16.1.0 includes a <a href="../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations">batched background migration</a> <code>MarkDuplicateNpmPackagesForDestruction</code> to mark duplicate NPM packages for destruction. Make sure the migration has completed successfully before upgrading to 16.3.0 or later.</li>
<li>A <code>BackfillCiPipelineVariablesForBigintConversion</code> background migration is finalized with
  the <code>EnsureBackfillBigintIdIsCompleted</code> post-deploy migration.
  GitLab 16.0.0 introduced a <a href="../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations">batched background migration</a> to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/118878">backfill <code>bigint</code> <code>id</code> values on the <code>ci_pipeline_variables</code> table</a>. This
  migration may take a long time to complete on larger GitLab instances (4 hours to process 50 million rows reported in one case).
  To avoid a prolonged upgrade downtime, make sure the migration has completed successfully before upgrading to 16.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the size of the <code>ci_pipeline_variables</code> table in the <a href="../../administration/troubleshooting/postgresql.md#start-a-database-console">database console</a>:</p>
<p><code>sql
  select count(*) from ci_pipeline_variables;</code></p>
<h3>Self-compiled installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must remove any settings related to Puma worker killer from the <code>puma.rb</code> configuration file, because those have been
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/118645">removed</a>. For more information, see the
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/16-0-stable-ee/config/puma.rb.example"><code>puma.rb.example</code></a> file.</p>

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>Specific information applies to Linux package installations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The binaries for PostgreSQL 12 have been removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to upgrading, administrators of Linux package installations must ensure the installation is using
  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server">PostgreSQL 13</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grafana that was bundled with GitLab is deprecated and is no longer supported.
  It is removed in GitLab 16.3.</li>
<li>This upgrades <code>openssh-server</code> to <code>1:8.9p1-3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <code>ssh-keyscan -t rsa</code> with older OpenSSH clients to obtain public key information is no longer viable because of
  the deprecations listed in <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.7">OpenSSH 8.7 Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Workaround is to make use of a different key type, or upgrade the client OpenSSH to a version &gt;= 8.7.</p>

<h3>Non-expiring access tokens</h3>
<p>Access tokens that have no expiration date are valid indefinitely, which is a

<h3>Gitaly configuration structure change</h3>
<p>The Gitaly configuration structure in the Linux package
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/4467">changes</a> in GitLab 16.0
to be consistent with the Gitaly configuration structure used in
self-compiled installations.</p>
<p>As a result of this change, a single hash under <code>gitaly['configuration']</code> holds most Gitaly
configuration. Some <code>gitaly['..']</code> configuration options continue to be used by GitLab 16.0 and later:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>enable</code></li>
<li><code>dir</code></li>
<li><code>bin_path</code></li>
<li><code>env_directory</code></li>
<li><code>env</code></li>
<li><code>open_files_ulimit</code></li>
<li><code>consul_service_name</code></li>
<li><code>consul_service_meta</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Migrate by moving your existing configuration under the new structure. <code>git_data_dirs</code> is supported <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/8786">until GitLab 18.0</a>. The new structure is supported from GitLab 15.10.</p>
<p><strong>Migrate to the new structure</strong></p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="warning" &gt;}}</p>
<p>If you are running Gitaly Cluster (Praefect), <a href="#praefect-configuration-structure-change">migrate Praefect to the new configuration structure <strong>first</strong></a>.
Once this change is tested, proceed with your Gitaly nodes.
If Gitaly is misconfigured as part of the configuration structure change, <a href="../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#repository-verification">repository verification</a>
will <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/5529">delete metadata required for Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) to work</a>.
To protect against configuration mistakes, temporarily disable repository verification in Praefect.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're running Gitaly Cluster (Praefect), ensure repository verification is disabled on all Praefect nodes.
   Configure <code>verification_interval: 0</code>, and apply with <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
<li>To apply the new structure to your configuration:</li>
<li>Replace the <code>...</code> with the value from the old key.</li>
<li>When configuring <code>storage</code> to replace <code>git_data_dirs</code>, <strong>append <code>/repositories</code> to value of <code>path</code></strong> as documented in the following script. If
      you don't complete this step, your Git repositories are inaccessible until the configuration is fixed. This
      misconfiguration can cause metadata deletion.</li>
<li>Skip any keys you haven't configured a value for previously.</li>
<li>Recommended. Include a trailing comma for all hash keys so the hash remains valid when keys are re-ordered or additional keys are added.</li>
<li>Apply the change with <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
<li>Test Git repository functionality in GitLab.</li>
<li>Remove the old keys from the configuration once migrated, and then re-run <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
<li>Recommended, if you're running Gitaly Cluster (Praefect). Reinstate Praefect <a href="../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#repository-verification">repository verification</a>
   by removing <code>verification_interval: 0</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new structure is documented in the following script with the old keys described in a comment above the new keys.</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="warning" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Double check your update to <code>storage</code>. You must append <code>/repositories</code> to the value of <code>path</code>.</p>

<h3>Praefect configuration structure change</h3>
<p>The Praefect configuration structure in the Linux package
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/4467">changes</a> in GitLab 16.0
to be consistent with the Praefect configuration structure used in
self-compiled installations.</p>
<p>As a result of this change, a single hash under <code>praefect['configuration']</code> holds most Praefect
configuration. Some <code>praefect['..']</code> configuration options continue to be used by GitLab 16.0 and later:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>enable</code></li>
<li><code>dir</code></li>
<li><code>log_directory</code></li>
<li><code>env_directory</code></li>
<li><code>env</code></li>
<li><code>wrapper_path</code></li>
<li><code>auto_migrate</code></li>
<li><code>consul_service_name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Migrate by moving your existing configuration under the new structure. The new structure is supported from GitLab 15.9.</p>
<p><strong>Migrate to the new structure</strong></p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="warning" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Migrate Praefect to the new configuration structure <strong>first</strong>.
Once this change is tested, <a href="#gitaly-configuration-structure-change">proceed with your Gitaly nodes</a>.
If Gitaly is misconfigured as part of the configuration structure change, <a href="../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#repository-verification">repository verification</a>
will <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/5529">delete metadata required for Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) to work</a>.
To protect against configuration mistakes, temporarily disable repository verification in Praefect.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>When applying the new structure to your configuration:</li>
<li>Replace the <code>...</code> with the value from the old key.</li>
<li>Disable repository verification using <code>verification_interval: 0</code>, as shown in the following script.</li>
<li>Skip any keys you haven't configured a value for previously.</li>
<li>Recommended. Include a trailing comma for all hash keys so the hash remains valid when keys are re-ordered or additional keys are added.</li>
<li>Apply the change with <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
<li>Test Git repository functionality in GitLab.</li>
<li>Remove the old keys from the configuration once migrated, and then re-run <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new structure is documented in the following script with the old keys described in a comment above the new keys.</p>

<h3>Disable the second database connection</h3>
<p>In GitLab 16.0, GitLab defaults to using two database connections that point to the same PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL might need to be configured with a larger value for <code>max_connections</code>.
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#configuring-multiple-database-connections">There is a Rake task for checking if this is necessary</a>.</p>
<p>If you have PgBouncer deployed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frontend pools (including file handle limits and <code>max_client_conn</code>) on your PgBouncer servers <a href="../../administration/postgresql/pgbouncer.md#fine-tuning">might need to be larger</a>.</li>
<li>PgBouncer is single threaded. The extra connections might fully saturate a single PgBouncer daemon.
  <a href="../../administration/reference_architectures/5k_users.md#configure-pgbouncer">We recommend running three load-balanced PgBouncer servers</a> for all
  scaled GitLab deployments, in part to address this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the instructions for your installation type to switch back to a single database connection:</p>
<p>{{&lt; tabs &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Linux package and Docker" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>Add this setting to <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   gitlab_rails['databases']['ci']['enable'] = false</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a multi-node environment, this setting should be updated on all Rails and Sidekiq nodes.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Helm chart (Kubernetes)" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Set the <code>ci.enabled</code> key to <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">global:
  psql:
    ci:
      enabled: false
</code></pre>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Self-compiled (source)" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Remove the <code>ci:</code> section from <code>config/database.yml</code>.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tabs &gt;}}</p>
<h2>Long-running user type data change</h2>
<p>GitLab 16.0 is a required stop for large GitLab instances with a lot of records in the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>The threshold is <strong>30,000 users</strong>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers and other users in any state, including active, blocked, and pending approval.</li>
<li>Bot accounts for project and group access tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>GitLab 16.0 introduced a <a href="../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations">batched background migration</a> to
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/115849">migrate <code>user_type</code> values from <code>NULL</code> to <code>0</code></a>. This
migration might take multiple days to complete on larger GitLab instances. Make sure the migration
has completed successfully before upgrading to 16.1.0 or later.</p>
<p>GitLab 16.1 introduces the <code>FinalizeUserTypeMigration</code> migration which ensures the
16.0 <code>MigrateHumanUserType</code> background migration is completed, executing the 16.0 change synchronously
during the upgrade if it's not completed.</p>
<p>GitLab 16.2 <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/122454">implements a <code>NOT NULL</code> database constraint</a>
which fails if the 16.0 migration is not complete.</p>
<p>If 16.0 has been skipped (or the 16.0 migration is not complete) subsequent
Linux package (Omnibus) and Docker upgrades might fail
after an hour:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: rails_migration[gitlab-rails]
[..]

</code></pre>
<p><a href="../package/package_troubleshooting.md#error-command-timed-out-after-3600s">There is a fix-forward workaround for this issue</a>.</p>
<p>While the workaround is completing the database changes, GitLab is likely to be in
an unusable state, generating <code>500</code> errors. The errors are caused by Sidekiq and Puma running
application code that is incompatible with the database schema.</p>
<p>At the end of the workaround process, Sidekiq and Puma are restarted to resolve that issue.</p>
<h2>Undefined column error upgrading to 16.2 or later</h2>
<p>A bug in GitLab 15.11 incorrectly disabled a database change on self-managed instances.
For more information, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408835">issue 408835</a>.</p>
<p>If your GitLab instance upgraded first to 15.11.0, 15.11.1, or 15.11.2 the database schema is
incorrect and upgrading to GitLab 16.2 or later fails with an error. A database change
requires the earlier modification to be in place:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:  column &quot;id_convert_to_bigint&quot; of relation &quot;ci_build_needs&quot; does not exist
LINE 1: ...db_config_name:main*/ UPDATE &quot;ci_build_needs&quot; SET &quot;id_conver...
</code></pre>
<p>GitLab 15.11.3 shipped a fix for this bug, but it doesn't correct the problem on
instances already running the earlier 15.11 releases.</p>
<p>If you're not sure if an instance is affected, check for the column on the
<a href="../../administration/troubleshooting/postgresql.md#start-a-database-console">database console</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select pg_typeof (id_convert_to_bigint) from public.ci_build_needs limit 1;
</code></pre>
<p>If you need the workaround, this query fails:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">ERROR:  column &quot;id_convert_to_bigintd&quot; does not exist
LINE 1: select pg_typeof (id_convert_to_bigintd) from public.ci_buil...
</code></pre>
<p>Unaffected instances return:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"> pg_typeof
-----------
 bigint
</code></pre>
<p>The workaround for this issue differs if your GitLab instance's database schema
was recently created:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Installation version</th>
<th>Workaround</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>15.9 or earlier</td>
<td><a href="#workaround-instance-created-with-159-or-earlier">15.9</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15.10</td>
<td><a href="#workaround-instance-created-with-1510">15.10</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15.11</td>
<td><a href="#workaround-instance-created-with-1511">15.11</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Most instances should use the 15.9 procedure. Only very new instances require the
15.10 or 15.11 procedures. If you've migrated GitLab using backup and restore,
the database schema comes from the original instance. Select the workaround based
on the source instance.</p>
