<p>This page contains upgrade information for minor and patch versions of GitLab 15.
Ensure you review these instructions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your installation type.</li>
<li>All versions between your current version and your target version.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional information for Helm chart installations, see
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/6_0.html">the Helm chart 6.0 upgrade notes</a>.</p>
<h2>15.11.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many <a href="../../user/import/_index.html">group and project importers</a> now require the Maintainer role instead of only
  requiring the Developer role. For more information, see the documentation for any importers you use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>15.11.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade to patch release 15.11.3 or later</strong>. This avoids <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408304">issue 408304</a> when upgrading from 15.5.0 and earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, backups in environments that have PgBouncer must <a href="../../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#bypassing-pgbouncer">bypass PgBouncer by setting variables that are prefixed with <code>GITLAB_BACKUP_</code></a>. However, due to an <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422163">issue</a>, <code>gitlab-backup</code> uses the regular database connection through PgBouncer instead of the direct connection defined in the override, and the database backup fails. The workaround is to use <code>pg_dump</code> directly.</p>

<h3>Linux package installations</h3>
<p>In GitLab 15.11, PostgreSQL will automatically be upgraded to 13.x except for the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are running the database in high availability using Patroni.</li>
<li>Your database nodes are part of a GitLab Geo configuration.</li>
<li>You have specifically <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#opt-out-of-automatic-postgresql-upgrades">opted out</a> from automatically upgrading PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>You have <code>postgresql['version'] = 12</code> in your <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fault-tolerant and Geo installations support manual upgrades to PostgreSQL 13,

<p>A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/7841">bug</a> in the
built-in <code>pg-upgrade</code> tool prevents upgrading the bundled PostgreSQL database
to version 13. This leaves the secondary site in a broken state, and prevents
upgrading the Geo installation to GitLab 16.x
(<a href="../deprecations.md#postgresql-12-deprecated">PostgreSQL 12 support has removed in 16.0</a> and later
releases). This occurs on secondary sites using the bundled PostgreSQL
software, running both the secondary main Rails database and tracking database
on the same node. There is a manual

<li>A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348453">bug with Terraform configuration</a> caused Terraform state to
  remain enabled even when <code>gitlab_rails['terraform_state_enabled']</code> was set to <code>false</code> in the <code>gitlab.rb</code> configuration
  file. Because this bug was fixed in GitLab 15.10, upgrading to GitLab 15.10 could break projects that use the
  <a href="../../administration/terraform_state.html">Terraform state</a> feature if it's disabled in the <code>gitlab.rb</code> configuration.
  If you have configured <code>gitlab_rails['terraform_state_enabled'] = false</code> in your <code>gitlab.rb</code>, check if any projects
  are using the Terraform state feature. To check:</li>
<li>Read the <a href="../../administration/operations/rails_console.html">Rails console</a> warning.</li>
<li>Start a <a href="../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session">Rails console session</a>.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>Terraform::State.pluck(:project_id)</code>. This command returns an array of all projects IDs that have a
     Terraform state.</li>
<li>Navigate to each project and work with stakeholders as necessary to determine if the Terraform state feature is
     actively used. If Terraform state is no longer needed, you can follow the steps to <a href="../../user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.md#remove-a-state-file">remove a state file</a>.</li>

<li>A <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408214">bug with Elastic Indexer Cron Workers</a> can cause saturation in Sidekiq.</li>
<li>When this issue occurs, merge request merges, pipelines, Slack notifications, and other events are not created or take a long time to occur.</li>

<li>A bug with the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/107730"><code>BackfillTraversalIdsToBlobsAndWikiBlobs</code> advanced search migration</a> might cause the Elasticsearch cluster to become saturated.</li>
<li>When this issue occurs, searches might become slow and updates to the Elasticsearch cluster might take a long time to complete.</li>
<li>To resolve this issue, upgrade to GitLab 15.10 to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/113719">reduce the migration batch size</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade to patch release 15.9.3 or later</strong>. This provides fixes for two database migration bugs:</li>
<li>Patch releases 15.9.0, 15.9.1, 15.9.2 have a bug that can cause data loss
    from the user profile fields <code>linkedin</code>, <code>twitter</code>, <code>skype</code>, <code>website_url</code>,
    <code>location</code>, and <code>organization</code>. For more information, see
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393216">issue 393216</a>.</li>
<li>The second <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/394760">bug fix</a> ensures it is possible to upgrade directly from 15.4.x.</li>
<li>As part of the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/ci_data_decay/pipeline_partitioning/">CI Partitioning effort</a>, a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/107547">new Foreign Key</a> was added to <code>ci_builds_needs</code>. On GitLab instances with large CI tables, adding this constraint can take longer than usual.</li>
<li>Praefect's metadata verifier <a href="../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#enable-deletions">invalid metadata deletion behavior</a> is now enabled by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>The metadata verifier processes replica records in the Praefect database and verifies the replicas actually exist on the Gitaly nodes. If the replica doesn't exist, its
  metadata record is deleted. This enables Praefect to fix situations where a replica has a metadata record indicating it's fine but, in reality, it doesn't exist on disk.
  After the metadata record is deleted, Praefect's reconciler schedules a replication job to recreate the replica.</p>
<p>Because of past issues with the state management logic, there may be invalid metadata records in the database. These could exist, for example, because of incomplete
  deletions of repositories or partially completed renames. The verifier deletes these stale replica records of affected repositories. These repositories may show up as
  unavailable repositories in the metrics and <code>praefect dataloss</code> sub-command because of the replica records being removed. If you encounter such repositories, remove
  the repository using <code>praefect remove-repository</code> to remove the repository's remaining records.</p>
<p>You can find repositories with invalid metadata records prior in GitLab 15.0 and later by searching for the log records outputted by the verifier. <a href="../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#repository-verification">Read more about repository verification, and to see an example log entry</a>.
- Praefect configuration changes significantly for Linux package instances in GitLab 16.0. You can begin migrating to the new structure in GitLab 15.9 while backwards compatibility is
  maintained in the lead up to GitLab 16.0. <a href="gitlab_16_changes.md#praefect-configuration-structure-change">Read more about this change</a>.</p>

<h2>15.7.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>This version validates a <code>NOT NULL DB</code> constraint on the <code>issues.work_item_type_id</code> column.
  To upgrade to this version, no records with a <code>NULL</code> <code>work_item_type_id</code> should exist on the <code>issues</code> table.
  There are multiple <code>BackfillWorkItemTypeIdForIssues</code> background migrations that will be finalized with
  the <code>EnsureWorkItemTypeBackfillMigrationFinished</code> post-deploy migration.</li>
<li>GitLab 15.4.0 introduced a <a href="../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations">batched background migration</a> to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91921">backfill <code>namespace_id</code> values on issues table</a>. This
  migration might take multiple hours or days to complete on larger GitLab instances. Make sure the migration
  has completed successfully before upgrading to 15.7.0.</li>
<li>
<p>A database constraint is added, specifying that the <code>namespace_id</code> column on the issues
  table has no <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <code>namespace_id</code> batched background migration from 15.4 failed (see previous item) then the 15.7 upgrade
    fails with a database migration error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On GitLab instances with large issues tables, validating this constraint causes the upgrade to take
    longer than usual. All database changes need to complete within a one-hour limit:</p>
<p><code>plaintext
FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: rails_migration[gitlab-rails]
[..]
Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: Command timed out after 3600s:</code></p>
<p>A workaround exists to <a href="../package/package_troubleshooting.md#error-command-timed-out-after-3600s">complete the data change and the upgrade manually</a>.
- The default Sidekiq <code>max_concurrency</code> has been changed to 20. This is now
  consistent in our documentation and product defaults.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, previously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux package installation default (<code>sidekiq['max_concurrency']</code>): 50</li>
<li>Self-compiled installation default: 50</li>
<li>Helm chart default (<code>gitlab.sidekiq.concurrency</code>): 25</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference architectures still use a default of 10 as this is set specifically
  for those configurations.</p>
<p>Sites that have configured <code>max_concurrency</code> will not be affected by this change.

- GitLab Runner 15.7.0 introduced a breaking change that affects CI/CD jobs: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/3613">Correctly handle expansion of job file variables</a>.
  Previously, job-defined variables that referred to
  <a href="../../ci/variables/_index.md#use-file-type-cicd-variables">file type variables</a>
  were expanded to the value of the file variable (its content). This behavior did not
  respect the typical rules of shell variable expansion. There was also the potential
  that secrets or sensitive information could leak if the file variable and its
  contents printed. For example, if they were printed in an echo output. For more information,
  see <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/02/13/impact-of-the-file-type-variable-change-15-7/">Understanding the file type variable expansion change in GitLab 15.7</a>.

<li>The default routing rule has been reverted in 15.4.5, so upgrading to that version or later will return to the previous behavior.</li>
<li>
<p>If a GitLab instance now listens only to the <code>default</code> queue (which is not currently recommended), it will be required to add this routing rule back in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>:</p>
<p><code>ruby
sidekiq['routing_rules'] = [['*', 'default']]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json</code> was modified in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/6310">GitLab 15.4</a>,
  and new configuration was added to <code>gitlab_pages</code>, <code>grafana</code>, and <code>mattermost</code> sections.
  In a highly available or GitLab Geo environment, secrets need to be the same on all nodes.
  If you're manually syncing the secrets file across nodes, or manually specifying secrets in
  <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>, make sure <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json</code> is the same on all nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>GitLab 15.4.0 introduced a <a href="../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations">batched background migration</a> to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91921">backfill <code>namespace_id</code> values on issues table</a>. This
  migration might take multiple hours or days to complete on larger GitLab instances. Make sure the migration
  has completed successfully before upgrading to 15.7.0 or later.</li>
<li>Due to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155">a bug introduced in GitLab 15.4</a>, if one or more Git repositories in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) is <a href="../../administration/gitaly/praefect/recovery.md#unavailable-repositories">unavailable</a>, then <a href="../../administration/repository_checks.html">Repository checks</a> and <a href="../../administration/geo/_index.html">Geo replication and verification</a> stop running for all project or project wiki repositories in the affected Gitaly Cluster (Praefect).

  Gitaly. The previous implementation in GitLab Shell was removed in GitLab 15.0. With this change, global server hooks are stored only inside a subdirectory named after the
  hook type. Global server hooks can no longer be a single hook file in the root of the custom hooks directory. For example, you must use <code>&lt;custom_hooks_dir&gt;/&lt;hook_name&gt;.d/*</code> rather
  than <code>&lt;custom_hooks_dir&gt;/&lt;hook_name&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>gitaly['custom_hooks_dir']</code> in <code>gitlab.rb</code> for Linux package instances. This replaces <code>gitlab_shell['custom_hooks_dir']</code>.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL 13.6 is being shipped as the default version for fresh installs and
  12.10 for upgrades. You can manually upgrade to PostgreSQL 13.6 following the

</ul>
<p><code>shell
  sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade -V 13</code></p>
<p>Until PostgreSQL 12 is removed, you may

<p><a href="../../administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.md#upgrading-postgresql-major-version-in-a-patroni-cluster">Fault tolerant and Geo installations require additional steps and planning</a>.</p>
<p>Because of underlying structural changes, the running PostgreSQL process
  must be restarted when it is upgraded before running database
  migrations. If automatic restart is skipped, you must run the following
  command before migrations are run:</p>
<p>```shell
  # If using PostgreSQL
  sudo gitlab-ctl restart postgresql</p>
<p># If using Patroni for Database replication
  sudo gitlab-ctl restart patroni
  ```</p>
<p>If PostgreSQL is not restarted, you might face
  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#could-not-load-library-plpgsqlso">errors related to loading libraries</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with GitLab 15.0, <code>postgresql</code> and <code>geo-postgresql</code> services are
  automatically restarted when the PostgreSQL version changes. Restarting
  PostgreSQL services causes downtime due to the temporary unavailability of the
  database for operations. While this restart is mandatory for proper functioning
  of the Database services, you might want more control over when the PostgreSQL
  is restarted. For that purpose, you can choose to skip the automatic restarts as
  part of <code>gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code> and manually restart the services.</li>
</ul>
<p>To skip automatic restarts as part of GitLab 15.0 upgrade, perform the following
  steps before the upgrade:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code> and add the following line:</p>
<p>```ruby
 # For PostgreSQL/Patroni
 postgresql['auto_restart_on_version_change'] = false</p>
<p># For Geo PostgreSQL
 geo_postgresql['auto_restart_on_version_change'] = false
 ```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconfigure GitLab:</p>
<p><code>shell
 sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>It is mandatory to restart PostgreSQL when underlying version changes, to avoid
  errors like the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#could-not-load-library-plpgsqlso">one related to loading necessary libraries</a>
  that can cause downtime. So, if you skip the automatic restarts using the previous
  method, ensure that you restart the services manually before upgrading to GitLab
  15.0.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Starting with GitLab 15.0, the <code>AES256-GCM-SHA384</code> SSL cipher will not be allowed by
  NGINX by default. If you use the
  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_en/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-ssl-security-policy.html#ssl-ciphers">AWS Classic Load Balancer</a> and require the cipher,
  you can add it back to the allowlist. To add the SSL cipher to the allowlist:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code> and add the following line:</p>
<p><code>ruby
 nginx['ssl_ciphers'] = "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES256-GCM-SHA384"</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconfigure GitLab:</p>
<p><code>shell

</li>
<li>
<p>Support for internal socket path for Gitaly is removed.
  In GitLab 14.10, Gitaly introduced a new directory that holds all runtime
  data Gitaly requires to operate correctly. This new directory replaces the
  old internal socket directory, and consequentially the usage of
  <code>gitaly['internal_socket_dir']</code> was deprecated in favor of
  <code>gitaly['runtime_dir']</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The old <code>gitaly['internal_socket_dir']</code> configuration was removed in this release.</p>
<ul>
<li>Background uploads settings for object storage are removed.
  Object storage now preferentially uses direct uploads.</li>

<p>The following keys are no longer supported in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gitlab_rails['artifacts_object_store_direct_upload']</code></li>

<h3>Self-compiled installations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for more than one database has been added to GitLab. For <strong>self-compiled (source) installations</strong>,
  <code>config/database.yml</code> must include a database name in the database configuration.
  The <code>main: database</code> must be first. If an invalid or deprecated syntax is used, an error is generated
  during application start:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>plaintext
  ERROR: This installation of GitLab uses unsupported 'config/database.yml'.
  The main: database needs to be defined as a first configuration item instead of primary. (RuntimeError)</code></p>
<p>Previously, the <code>config/database.yml</code> file looked like the following:</p>
<p><code>yaml
  production:
    adapter: postgresql
    encoding: unicode
    database: gitlabhq_production
    ...</code></p>
<p>Starting with GitLab 15.0, it must define a <code>main</code> database first:</p>
<p><code>yaml
  production:
    main:
      adapter: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      database: gitlabhq_production
      ...</code></p>
