<p>The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
The <code>geo_secondary_proxy_separate_urls</code> feature flag is planned to be deprecated and removed in a future release.
Support for read-only Geo secondary sites is proposed in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366810">issue 366810</a>.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>Secondary sites behave as full read-write GitLab instances. They transparently proxy all operations to the primary site, with <a href="#features-accelerated-by-secondary-geo-sites">some notable exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>This behavior enables use-cases including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting all Geo sites behind a single URL, to deliver a consistent, seamless, and comprehensive experience whichever site the user lands on. Users don't need to juggle multiple GitLab URLs.</li>
<li>Geographically load-balancing traffic without worrying about write access.</li>

<h2>Set up a unified URL for Geo sites</h2>
<p>Secondary sites can transparently serve read-write traffic. Therefore, you can
use a single external URL so that requests can hit either the primary Geo site
or any secondary Geo sites. This delivers a consistent, seamless, and
comprehensive experience whichever site the user lands on. Users don't need to
juggle multiple URLs or even be aware of the idea of multiple sites.</p>
<p>You can route traffic to Geo sites with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geo-location aware DNS. To route traffic to the closest Geo site, whether primary or secondary. For an example, follow <a href="#configure-location-aware-dns">Configure location-aware DNS</a>.</li>
<li>Round-robin DNS.</li>
<li>A load-balancer. It must use sticky sessions to avoid authentication failures and cross-site request errors. DNS routing is inherently sticky so it does not share this caveat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configure location-aware DNS</h3>
<p>Follow this example to route traffic to the closest Geo site, whether primary or secondary.</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>This example creates a <code>gitlab.example.com</code> subdomain that automatically directs
requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>From Europe to a <strong>secondary</strong> site.</li>
<li>From all other locations to the <strong>primary</strong> site.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A working Geo <strong>primary</strong> site and <strong>secondary</strong> site, see the <a href="../setup/_index.html">Geo setup instructions</a>.</li>
<li>A DNS zone managing your domain. Although the following instructions use
  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">AWS Route53</a>
  and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns/">GCP cloud DNS</a>, other services such as
  <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> can be used as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4>AWS Route53</h4>
<p>In this example, you use a Route53 Hosted Zone managing your domain for the Route53 setup.</p>
<p>In a Route53 Hosted Zone, traffic policies can be used to set up a variety of
routing configurations. To create a traffic policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the
   <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home">Route53 dashboard</a> and select
   <strong>Traffic policies</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create traffic policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Policy Name</strong> field with <code>Single Git Host</code> and select <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Leave <strong>DNS type</strong> as <code>A: IP Address in IPv4 format</code>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect to</strong>, then select <strong>Geolocation rule</strong>.</li>
<li>For the first <strong>Location</strong>:</li>
<li>Leave it as <code>Default</code>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect to</strong>, then select <strong>New endpoint</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Type</strong> <code>value</code> and fill it in with <code>&lt;your **primary** IP address&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>For the second <strong>Location</strong>:</li>
<li>Choose <code>Europe</code>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Connect to</strong>, then select <strong>New endpoint</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Type</strong> <code>value</code> and fill it in with <code>&lt;your **secondary** IP address&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Route53 traffic policy editor showing a geolocation rule with two locations - Default and Europe - each connected to endpoints with different IP addresses" src="img/single_url_add_traffic_policy_endpoints_v14_5.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Create traffic policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Fill in <strong>Policy record DNS name</strong> with <code>gitlab</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Web form for creating DNS policy records with fields for traffic policy, version, hosted zone, and DNS configuration settings" src="img/single_url_create_policy_records_with_traffic_policy_v14_5.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Create policy records</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have successfully set up a single host, like <code>gitlab.example.com</code>, which
distributes traffic to your Geo sites by geolocation.</p>
<h4>GCP</h4>
<p>In this example, you create a GCP Cloud DNS zone managing your domain.</p>
<p>When creating Geo-Based record sets, GCP applies a nearest match for the source region when the source of the traffic doesn't match any policy items exactly. To create a Geo-Based record set:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Network Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Cloud DNS</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the Zone configured for your domain.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add Record Set</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the DNS Name for your Location-aware public URL, for example, <code>gitlab.example.com</code>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Routing Policy</strong>: <strong>Geo-Based</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add Managed RRData</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Source Region</strong>: <strong>us-central1</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your <code>&lt;**primary** IP address&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add Managed RRData</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Source Region</strong>: <strong>europe-west1</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your <code>&lt;**secondary** IP address&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have successfully set up a single host, like <code>gitlab.example.com</code>, which
distributes traffic to your Geo sites using a location-aware URL.</p>
<h3>Configure each site to use the same external URL</h3>
<p>After you have set up routing from a single URL to all of your Geo sites, follow
the following steps if your sites use different URLs:</p>
<ol>
<li>On each GitLab site, SSH into <strong>each</strong> node running Rails (Puma, Sidekiq, Log-Cursor)
   and set the <code>external_url</code> to that of the single URL:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo -e /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Reconfigure the updated nodes for the change to take effect:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
<ol>
<li>To match the new external URL set on the secondary Geo sites, the primary database
   needs to reflect this change.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Geo administration page of the <strong>primary</strong> site, edit each Geo secondary that
   is using the secondary proxying and set the <code>URL</code> field to the single URL.
   Make sure the primary site is also using this URL.</p>
<p>To allow the sites to talk to each other, <a href="../../geo_sites.md#set-up-the-internal-urls">make sure the <code>Internal URL</code> field is unique for each site</a>.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, you can <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/geo/">use the same domain under <code>global.hosts.domain</code> as for the primary site</a>.</p>
<h2>Set up a separate URL for a secondary Geo site</h2>
<p>You can use different external URLs per site. You can use this to offer a specific site to a specific set of users. Alternatively, you can give users control over which site they use, though they must understand the implications of their choice.</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>GitLab does not support multiple external URLs, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21319">issue 21319</a>. An inherent problem is there are many cases where a site needs to produce an absolute URL outside of the context of an HTTP request, such as when sending emails that were not triggered by a request.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<h3>Configure a secondary Geo site to a different external URL than the primary site</h3>
<p>If your secondary site uses the same external URL as the primary site,
but you want to change it to use a different URL:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the secondary site, SSH into <strong>each</strong> node running Rails (Puma, Sidekiq, Log-Cursor)
   and set the <code>external_url</code> to the desired URL for the secondary site:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo -e /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Reconfigure the updated nodes for the change to take effect:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
<ol>
<li>To match the new external URL set on the secondary Geo site, the primary database
   needs to reflect this change.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Geo administration page of the <strong>primary</strong> site, edit the target secondary site and set the <code>URL</code> field to the desired URL.</p>
<p>To allow the sites to talk to each other, <a href="../../geo_sites.md#set-up-the-internal-urls">make sure the <code>Internal URL</code> field is unique for each site</a>. If the desired URL is unique to this site, then you can clear the <code>Internal URL</code> field. On save, it defaults to the external URL.</p>
<h2>Behavior of secondary sites when the primary Geo site is down</h2>
<p>Considering that web traffic is proxied to the primary, the behavior of the secondary sites differs when the primary
site is inaccessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI and API traffic return the same errors as the primary (or fail if the primary is not accessible at all) because they are proxied.</li>
<li>For repositories that are fully up-to-date on the specific secondary site being accessed, Git read operations still work as expected,
  including authentication through HTTP(s) or SSH. However, Git reads performed by GitLab Runners will fail.</li>
<li>Git operations for repositories that are not replicated to the secondary site return the same errors
  as the primary site because they are proxied.</li>
<li>All Git write operations return the same errors as the primary site because they are proxied.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features accelerated by secondary Geo sites</h2>
<p>Most HTTP traffic sent to a secondary Geo site is proxied to the primary Geo site. With this architecture,
secondary Geo sites are able to support write requests, and avoid read-after-write problems. Certain
<strong>read</strong> requests are handled locally by secondary sites for improved latency and bandwidth nearby.</p>
<p>The following table details the components tested through the Geo secondary site Workhorse proxy.
It does not cover all data types.</p>
<p>In this context, accelerated reads refer to read requests served from the secondary site, provided that the data is up to date for the component on the secondary site. If the data on the secondary site is determined to be out of date, the request is forwarded to the primary site. Read requests for components not listed in the table below are always automatically forwarded to the primary site.</p>

<h2>Disable secondary site HTTP proxying</h2>
<p>Secondary site HTTP proxying is enabled by default on a secondary site when it uses a unified URL, meaning, it is configured with the same <code>external_url</code> as the primary site. Disabling proxying in this case tends not to be helpful due to completely different behavior being served at the same URL, depending on routing. When HTTP proxying is disabled on a secondary Geo site, the site operates in read-only mode, with several important limitations you should be aware of.</p>
<h3>What happens if you disable secondary proxying</h3>
<p>Disabling the proxying feature flag has the following general effects.</p>
<h4>HTTP and Git requests</h4>
<ul>
<li>The secondary site does not proxy HTTP requests to the primary site. Instead, it attempts to serve them itself, or fail.</li>
<li>Git requests generally succeed. Git pushes are redirected or proxied to the primary site.</li>
<li>Other than Git requests, any HTTP request which may write data fails. Read requests generally succeed.</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p>You should use the feature flag over using the <code>GEO_SECONDARY_PROXY</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>HTTP proxying is enabled by default in GitLab 15.1 on a secondary site even without a unified URL.</p>
<h4>Terms of service acceptance</h4>
<p>When proxying is disabled, users who access only the secondary site cannot properly accept terms of service or other legal agreements. This creates the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No record of acceptance</strong>: If an employee only logs into the secondary site, their acceptance of terms and conditions is not recorded in the primary database because write operations (including terms acceptance) are not proxied when secondary proxying is disabled, even though they may be presented with the terms message.</li>
<li><strong>Legal compliance concerns</strong>: Organizations may lack proper legal coverage if employees use GitLab services through a secondary-only access pattern, since there's no verifiable record of their agreement to the terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a workaround, you must access the primary site at least once to properly accept terms and conditions. After accepted on the primary, this information is replicated to secondary sites through normal Geo synchronization.</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}
This limitation affects organizations that require documented acceptance of terms and conditions for compliance or legal purposes. Ensure users have access to the primary site for the initial terms acceptance.
{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<h3>Disable proxy on all secondary sites</h3>
<p>If you need to disable proxying on all secondary sites, it is easiest to disable the feature flag:</p>
<p>{{&lt; tabs &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>SSH into a node which is running Puma or Sidekiq on your primary Geo site and run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-rails runner "Feature.disable(:geo_secondary_proxy_separate_urls)"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart Puma on all nodes which are running it on your secondary Geo site:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart puma</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Helm chart (Kubernetes)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>On your primary Geo site, run this command in the Toolbox pod:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   kubectl exec -it &lt;toolbox-pod-name&gt; -- gitlab-rails runner "Feature.disable(:geo_secondary_proxy_separate_urls)"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the Webservice pods on your secondary Geo site:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   kubectl rollout restart deployment -l app=webservice</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tabs &gt;}}</p>
<p>To revert the changes so secondary site proxying is enabled again:</p>
<p>{{&lt; tabs &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>SSH into a node which is running Puma or Sidekiq on your primary Geo site and run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-rails runner "Feature.enable(:geo_secondary_proxy_separate_urls)"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart Puma on all nodes which are running it on your secondary Geo site:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart puma</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Helm chart (Kubernetes)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>On your primary Geo site, run this command in the Toolbox pod:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   kubectl exec -it &lt;toolbox-pod-name&gt; -- gitlab-rails runner "Feature.enable(:geo_secondary_proxy_separate_urls)"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the Webservice pods on your secondary Geo site:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   kubectl rollout restart deployment -l app=webservice</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tabs &gt;}}</p>
<h3>Disable secondary site HTTP proxying per site</h3>
<p>If there are multiple secondary sites, you can disable HTTP proxying on each secondary site separately, by following these steps:</p>
<p>{{&lt; tabs &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>SSH into each application node (serving user traffic directly) on your secondary Geo site
   and add the following environment variable:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo -e /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code></p>
<p><code>ruby
   gitlab_workhorse['env'] = {
     "GEO_SECONDARY_PROXY" =&gt; "0"
   }</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Reconfigure the updated nodes for the change to take effect:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Helm chart (Kubernetes)" &gt;}}</p>
<p>You can use <code>--set gitlab.webservice.extraEnv.GEO_SECONDARY_PROXY="0"</code>,
or specify the following in your values file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">gitlab:
  webservice:
    extraEnv:
      GEO_SECONDARY_PROXY: &quot;0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
