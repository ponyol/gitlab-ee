<p>You can limit the number of concurrent operations the sites can run
in the background.</p>
<h2>Changing the sync/verification concurrency values</h2>
<p>On the <strong>primary</strong> site:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit</strong> of the secondary site you want to tune.</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>Tuning settings</strong>, there are several variables that can be tuned to
   improve the performance of Geo:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repository synchronization concurrency limit</p>
</li>
<li>File synchronization concurrency limit</li>
<li>Container repositories synchronization concurrency limit</li>
<li>Verification concurrency limit</li>
</ol>
<p>Increasing the concurrency values increases the number of jobs that are scheduled.
However, this may not lead to more downloads in parallel unless the number of
available Sidekiq threads is also increased. For example, if repository synchronization
concurrency is increased from 25 to 50, you may also want to increase the number
of Sidekiq threads from 25 to 50. See the
<a href="../../sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes.md#concurrency">Sidekiq concurrency documentation</a>
for more details.</p>
<h2>Tuning low default settings</h2>
<p>To avoid excessive load when setting up new Geo sites, starting with GitLab 18.0,
Geo's concurrency settings are set to low defaults for most environments.
To increase these settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>Decide which data types are progressing too slowly.</li>
<li>Watch load metrics of the primary and secondary sites.</li>
<li>Increase concurrency limits by 10 to be conservative.</li>
<li>Watch changes in progress and load metrics for at least 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Repeat increasing the limits until either load metrics reach your desired maximum, or syncing and verification is progressing as quickly as desired.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Repository re-verification</h2>
