<h2>Basic troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Before attempting more advanced troubleshooting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check <a href="#check-the-health-of-the-geo-sites">the health of the Geo sites</a>.</li>
<li>Check <a href="#check-if-postgresql-replication-is-working">if PostgreSQL replication is working</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Check the health of the Geo sites</h3>
<p>On the <strong>primary</strong> site:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We perform the following health checks on each <strong>secondary</strong> site
to help identify if something is wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the site running?</li>
<li>Is the secondary site's database configured for streaming replication?</li>
<li>Is the secondary site's tracking database configured?</li>
<li>Is the secondary site's tracking database connected?</li>
<li>Is the secondary site's tracking database up-to-date?</li>
<li>Is the secondary site's status less than 1 hour old?</li>
</ul>
<p>A site shows as "Unhealthy" if the site's status is more than 1 hour old. In that case, try running the following in the <a href="../../../operations/rails_console.html">Rails console</a> on the affected secondary site:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">Geo::MetricsUpdateWorker.new.perform
</code></pre>
<p>If it raises an error, then the error is probably also preventing the jobs from completing. If it takes longer than 1 hour, then the status might flap or persist as "Unhealthy", even if the status does occasionally get updated. This might be due to growth in usage, growth in data over time, or performance bugs such as a missing database index.</p>
<p>You can monitor system CPU load with a utility like <code>top</code> or <code>htop</code>. If PostgreSQL is using a significant amount of CPU, it might indicate that there's a problem, or that the system is underprovisioned. System memory should also be monitored.</p>
<p>If you increase memory, you should also check the PostgreSQL memory-related settings in your <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code> configuration.</p>
<p>If it successfully updates the status, then something may be wrong with Sidekiq. Is it running? Do the logs show errors? This job is supposed to be enqueued every minute and might not run if a <a href="../../../sidekiq/sidekiq_troubleshooting.md#clearing-a-sidekiq-job-deduplication-idempotency-key">job deduplication idempotency</a> key was not cleared properly. It takes an exclusive lease in Redis to ensure that only one of these jobs can run at a time. The primary site updates its status directly in the PostgreSQL database. Secondary sites send an HTTP Post request to the primary site with their status data.</p>
<p>A site also shows as "Unhealthy" if certain health checks fail. You can reveal the failure by running the following in the <a href="../../../operations/rails_console.html">Rails console</a> on the affected secondary site:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">Gitlab::Geo::HealthCheck.new.perform_checks
</code></pre>
<p>If it returns <code>""</code> (an empty string) or <code>"Healthy"</code>, then the checks succeeded. If it returns anything else, then the message should explain what failed, or show the exception message.</p>
<p>For information about how to resolve common error messages reported from the user interface,
see <a href="#fixing-common-errors">Fixing Common Errors</a>.</p>
<p>If the user interface is not working, or you are unable to sign in, you can run the Geo
health check manually to get this information and a few more details.</p>
<h4>Health check Rake task</h4>
<p>{{&lt; history &gt;}}</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of a custom NTP server was <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/105514">introduced</a> in GitLab 15.7.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{&lt; /history &gt;}}</p>
<p>This Rake task can be run on a <strong>Rails</strong> node in the <strong>primary</strong> or <strong>secondary</strong>
Geo sites:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check
</code></pre>
<p>Example output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Checking Geo ...

GitLab Geo is available ... yes
GitLab Geo is enabled ... yes
This machine's Geo node name matches a database record ... yes, found a secondary node named &quot;Shanghai&quot;

OpenSSH configured to use AuthorizedKeysCommand ... yes
GitLab configured to disable writing to authorized_keys file ... yes
GitLab configured to store new projects in hashed storage? ... yes

Checking Geo ... Finished
</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify a custom NTP server using environment variables. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check NTP_HOST=&quot;ntp.ubuntu.com&quot; NTP_TIMEOUT=&quot;30&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The following environment variables are supported.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Default value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>NTP_HOST</code></td>
<td>The NTP host.</td>
<td><code>pool.ntp.org</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>NTP_PORT</code></td>
<td>The NTP port the host listens on.</td>
<td><code>123</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>NTP_TIMEOUT</code></td>
<td>The NTP timeout in seconds.</td>
<td>The value defined in the <code>net-ntp</code> Ruby library (<a href="https://github.com/zencoder/net-ntp/blob/3d0990214f439a5127782e0f50faeaf2c8ca7023/lib/net/ntp/ntp.rb#L6">60 seconds</a>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the Rake task skips the <code>OpenSSH configured to use AuthorizedKeysCommand</code> check, the
following output displays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">OpenSSH configured to use AuthorizedKeysCommand ... skipped
  Reason:
  Cannot access OpenSSH configuration file
  Try fixing it:
  This is expected if you are using SELinux. You may want to check configuration manually
  For more information see:
  doc/administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.md
</code></pre>
<p>This issue might occur if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You use <a href="../../../operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.md#selinux-support">SELinux</a>.</li>
<li>You don't use SELinux, and the <code>git</code> user cannot access the OpenSSH configuration file due to restricted file permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter case, the following output shows that only the <code>root</code> user can read this file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo stat -c '%G:%U %A %a %n' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

root:root -rw------- 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>
<p>To allow the <code>git</code> user to read the OpenSSH configuration file, without changing the file owner or permissions, use <code>acl</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo setfacl -m u:git:r /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>
<h4>Sync status Rake task</h4>
<p>Current sync information can be found manually by running this Rake task on any
node running Rails (Puma, Sidekiq, or Geo Log Cursor) on the Geo <strong>secondary</strong> site.</p>
<p>GitLab does <strong>not</strong> verify objects that are stored in Object Storage. If you are using Object Storage, you will see all of the "verified" checks showing 0 successes. This is expected and not a cause for concern.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gitlab-rake geo:status
</code></pre>
<p>The output includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a count of "failed" items if any failures occurred</li>
<li>the percentage of "succeeded" items, relative to the "total"</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">                        Geo Site Information

<h5>Message: Machine clock is synchronized ... Exception</h5>
<p>The Rake task attempts to verify that the server clock is synchronized with NTP. Synchronized clocks
are required for Geo to function correctly. As an example, for security, when the server time on the
primary site and secondary site differ by about a minute or more, requests between Geo sites
fail. If this check task fails to complete due to a reason other than mismatching times, it
does not necessarily mean that Geo will not work.</p>
<p>The Ruby gem which performs the check is hard coded with <code>pool.ntp.org</code> as its reference time source.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exception message <code>Machine clock is synchronized ... Exception: Timeout::Error</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This issue occurs when your server cannot access the host <code>pool.ntp.org</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exception message <code>Machine clock is synchronized ... Exception: No route to host - recvfrom(2)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This issue occurs when the hostname <code>pool.ntp.org</code> resolves to a server which does not provide a time service.</p>
<p>In this case, in GitLab 15.7 and later, <a href="#health-check-rake-task">specify a custom NTP server using environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>In GitLab 15.6 and earlier, use one of the following workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add entries in <code>/etc/hosts</code> for <code>pool.ntp.org</code> to direct the request to valid local time servers.
  This fixes the long timeout and the timeout error.</li>
<li>Direct the check to any valid IP address. This resolves the timeout issue, but the check fails
  with the <code>No route to host</code> error, as noted previously.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should make sure your <strong>primary</strong> Geo <a href="../../glossary.html">site</a> points to
the database node that has write permissions.</p>
<p>Any <strong>secondary</strong> sites should point only to read-only database nodes.</p>
<h4>Can Geo detect the current site correctly?</h4>
<p>Geo finds the current Puma or Sidekiq node's Geo <a href="../../glossary.html">site</a> name in
<code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code> with the following logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the "Geo node name" (there is
   <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335944">an issue to rename the settings to "Geo site name"</a>):</li>
<li>Linux package: get the <code>gitlab_rails['geo_node_name']</code> setting.</li>
<li>GitLab Helm charts: get the <code>global.geo.nodeName</code> setting (see <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/geo/">Charts with GitLab Geo</a>).</li>
<li>If that is not defined, then get the <code>external_url</code> setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>This name is used to look up the Geo site with the same <strong>Name</strong> in the <strong>Geo Sites</strong>
dashboard.</p>
<p>To check if the current machine has a site name that matches a site in the
database, run the check task:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check
</code></pre>
<p>It displays the current machine's site name and whether the matching database
record is a <strong>primary</strong> or <strong>secondary</strong> site.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">This machine's Geo node name matches a database record ... yes, found a secondary node named &quot;Shanghai&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">This machine's Geo node name matches a database record ... no
  Try fixing it:
  You could add or update a Geo node database record, setting the name to &quot;https://example.com/&quot;.
  Or you could set this machine's Geo node name to match the name of an existing database record: &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Shanghai&quot;
  For more information see:
  doc/administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting/_index.md#can-geo-detect-the-current-node-correctly
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about recommended site names in the description of the Name field, see
<a href="../../../geo_sites.md#common-settings">Geo <strong>Admin</strong> area Common Settings</a>.</p>
<h3>Check OS locale data compatibility</h3>
<p>If at all possible, all Geo nodes across all sites should be deployed with the same method and operating system, as defined in the <a href="../../_index.md#requirements-for-running-geo">requirements for running Geo</a>.</p>
<p>If different operating systems or different operating system versions are deployed across Geo sites, you <strong>must</strong> perform a locale data compatibility check before setting up Geo. You must also check <code>glibc</code> when using a mixture of GitLab deployment methods. The locale might be different between a Linux package install, a GitLab Docker container, a Helm chart deployment, or external database services. See the <a href="../../../postgresql/upgrading_os.html">documentation on upgrading operating systems for PostgreSQL</a>, including how to check <code>glibc</code> version compatibility.</p>
<p>Geo uses PostgreSQL and Streaming Replication to replicate data across Geo sites. PostgreSQL uses locale data provided by the operating system's C library for sorting text. If the locale data in the C library is incompatible across Geo sites, it causes erroneous query results that lead to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360723">incorrect behavior on secondary sites</a>.</p>
<p>For example, Ubuntu 18.04 (and earlier) and RHEL/CentOS 7 (and earlier) are incompatible with their later releases.
See the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Locale_data_changes">PostgreSQL wiki for more details</a>.</p>
<h2>Fixing common errors</h2>
<p>This section documents common error messages reported in the <strong>Admin</strong> area on the web interface, and how to fix them.</p>
<h3>An existing tracking database cannot be reused</h3>
<p>Geo cannot reuse an existing tracking database.</p>
<p>It is safest to use a fresh secondary, or reset the whole secondary by following
<a href="synchronization_verification.md#resetting-geo-secondary-site-replication">Resetting Geo secondary site replication</a>.</p>
<p>It is risky to reuse a secondary site without resetting it because the secondary site may have missed some Geo events. For example, missed deletion events lead to the secondary site permanently having data that should be deleted. Similarly, losing an event which physically moves the location of data leads to data permanently orphaned in one location, and missing in the other location until it is re-verified. This is why GitLab switched to hashed storage, which makes moving data unnecessary. There may be other unknown problems due to lost events.</p>
<p>If these kinds of risks do not apply, for example in a test environment, or if you know that the main Postgres database still contains all Geo events since the Geo site was added, then you can bypass this health check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the last processed event time. In Rails console in the <strong>secondary</strong> site, run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   Geo::EventLogState.last.created_at.utc</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the output, for example <code>2024-02-21 23:50:50.676918 UTC</code>.</li>
<li>Update the created time of the secondary site to make it appear older. In Rails console in the <strong>primary</strong> site, run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   GeoNode.secondary_nodes.last.update_column(:created_at, DateTime.parse('2024-02-21 23:50:50.676918 UTC') - 1.second)</code></p>
<p>This command assumes that the affected secondary site is the one that was created last.</p>
<ol>
<li>Update the secondary site's status in <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>. In Rails console in the <strong>secondary</strong> site, run:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   Geo::MetricsUpdateWorker.new.perform</code></p>
<ol>
<li>The secondary site should appear healthy. If it does not, run <code>gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check</code> on the secondary site, or try restarting Rails if you haven't done so since re-adding the secondary site.</li>
<li>To resync missing or out-of-date data, go to <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>Under the secondary site select <strong>Replication Details</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Reverify all</strong> for every data type.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Geo site has a database that is writable</h3>
<p>This error message refers to a problem with the database replica on a <strong>secondary</strong> site,
which Geo expects to have access to. A secondary site database that is writable
is an indication the database is not configured for replication with the primary site. It usually means, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>An unsupported replication method was used (for example, logical replication).</li>
<li>The instructions to set up a <a href="../../setup/database.html">Geo database replication</a> were not followed correctly.</li>
<li>Your database connection details are incorrect, that is you have specified the wrong
  user in your <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geo <strong>secondary</strong> sites require two separate PostgreSQL instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>A read-only replica of the <strong>primary</strong> site.</li>
<li>A regular, writable instance that holds replication metadata. That is, the Geo tracking database.</li>
</ul>
<p>This error message indicates that the replica database in the <strong>secondary</strong> site is misconfigured and replication has stopped.</p>
<p>To restore the database and resume replication, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="synchronization_verification.md#resetting-geo-secondary-site-replication">Reset the Geo secondary site replication</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../setup/_index.md#using-linux-package-installations">Set up a new Geo secondary using the Linux package</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you set up a new secondary from scratch, you must also <a href="../remove_geo_site.html">remove the old site from the Geo cluster</a>.</p>
<h3>Geo site does not appear to be replicating the database from the primary site</h3>
<p>The most common problems that prevent the database from replicating correctly are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secondary</strong> sites cannot reach the <strong>primary</strong> site. Check credentials and
  <a href="../../_index.md#firewall-rules">firewall rules</a>.</li>
<li>SSL certificate problems. Make sure you copied <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json</code> from the <strong>primary</strong> site.</li>
<li>Database storage disk is full.</li>
<li>Database replication slot is misconfigured.</li>
<li>Database is not using a replication slot or another alternative and cannot catch-up because WAL files were purged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you follow the <a href="../../setup/database.html">Geo database replication</a> instructions for supported configuration.</p>
<h3>Geo database version (...) does not match latest migration (...)</h3>
<p>If you are using the Linux package installation, something might have failed during upgrade. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code>.</li>
<li>Manually trigger the database migration by running: <code>sudo gitlab-rake db:migrate:geo</code> as root on the <strong>secondary</strong> site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GitLab indicates that more than 100% of repositories were synced</h3>
<p>This can be caused by orphaned records in the project registry. They are being cleaned
periodically using a registry worker, so give it some time to fix it itself.</p>
<h3>Failed checksums on primary site</h3>
<p>Failed checksums identified by the Geo Primary Verification information screen can be caused by missing files or mismatched checksums. You can find error messages like <code>"Repository cannot be checksummed because it does not exist"</code> or <code>"File is not checksummable"</code> in the <code>gitlab-rails/geo.log</code> file.</p>
<p>For additional information about failed items, run the <a href="../../../raketasks/check.md#uploaded-files-integrity">integrity check Rake tasks</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:artifacts:check
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:ci_secure_files:check
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:lfs:check
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:uploads:check
</code></pre>
<p>For detailed information about individual errors, use the <code>VERBOSE=1</code> variable.</p>
<h3>Secondary site shows <strong>Unhealthy</strong> in UI</h3>
<p>If you have updated the value of <code>external_url</code> in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code> for the primary site or changed the protocol from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code>, you may see that secondary sites are shown as <strong>Unhealthy</strong>. You may also find the following error in <code>geo.log</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">&quot;class&quot;: &quot;Geo::NodeStatusRequestService&quot;,
...
&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Failed to Net::HTTP::Post to primary url: http://primary-site.gitlab.tld/api/v4/geo/status&quot;,
  &quot;error&quot;: &quot;Failed to open TCP connection to &lt;PRIMARY_IP_ADDRESS&gt;:80 (Connection refused - connect(2) for \&quot;&lt;PRIMARY_ID_ADDRESS&gt;\&quot; port 80)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, make sure to update the changed URL on all your sites:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the URL and save the change.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Message: <code>ERROR: canceling statement due to conflict with recovery</code> during backup</h3>
<p>Running a backup on a Geo <strong>secondary</strong> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211668">is not supported</a>.</p>
<p>When running a backup on a <strong>secondary</strong> you might encounter the following error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Dumping PostgreSQL database gitlabhq_production ...
pg_dump: error: Dumping the contents of table &quot;notes&quot; failed: PQgetResult() failed.
pg_dump: error: Error message from server: ERROR:  canceling statement due to conflict with recovery
DETAIL:  User query might have needed to see row versions that must be removed.
pg_dump: error: The command was: COPY public.notes (id, note, [...], last_edited_at) TO stdout;
</code></pre>
<p>To prevent a database backup being made automatically during GitLab upgrades on your Geo <strong>secondaries</strong>,
create the following empty file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo touch /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-backup
</code></pre>
<h3>High CPU usage on primary during object verification</h3>
<p>From GitLab 16.11 to GitLab 17.2, a missing PostgreSQL index causes high CPU
usage and slow artifact verification progress. Additionally, the Geo secondary
sites might report as unhealthy. <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471727">Issue 471727</a> describes the behavior in detail.</p>
<p>To determine if you might be experiencing this issue, follow the steps to
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471727#to-confirm-if-you-are-affected">confirm if you are affected</a>.</p>
<p>If you are affected, follow the steps in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471727#workaround">workaround</a>
to manually create the index. Creating the index causes PostgreSQL to
consume slightly more resources until it finishes. Afterward, CPU usage might
remain high while verification continues, but queries should complete
significantly faster, and secondary site status should update correctly.</p>
<h3>Verification failed with: <code>Verification timed out after (...)</code></h3>
<p>From GitLab 16.11, Geo may create duplicate <code>JobArtifactRegistry</code> entries for the same <code>artifact_id</code>, which can lead to synchronization
failures between primary and secondary sites. This issue may also impact <code>UploadRegistry</code> and <code>PackageFileRegistry</code> entries.</p>
<p>To determine if you might be experiencing this issue and remove the duplicate entries:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a <a href="../../../operations/rails_console.html">Rails console</a> in the secondary site.</li>
<li>Get the number of model record IDs that have duplicates:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   artifact_ids = Geo::JobArtifactRegistry.group(:artifact_id).having('COUNT(*) &gt; 1').pluck(:artifact_id); artifact_ids.size
   upload_ids = Geo::UploadRegistry.group(:file_id).having('COUNT(*) &gt; 1').pluck(:file_id); upload_ids.size
   package_file_ids = Geo::PackageFileRegistry.group(:package_file_id).having('COUNT(*) &gt; 1').pluck(:package_file_id); package_file_ids.size</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Output the IDs:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   puts 'BEGIN Artifact IDs', artifact_ids, 'END Artifact IDs'
   puts 'BEGIN Upload IDs', upload_ids, 'END Upload IDs'
   puts 'BEGIN Package File IDs', package_file_ids, 'END Package File IDs'</code></p>
<p>If the output is empty, you are not affected. Otherwise, save
   the terminal output in a text file in case you lose connection later.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete all duplicates:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   Geo::JobArtifactRegistry.where(artifact_id: artifact_ids).delete_all
   Geo::UploadRegistry.where(file_id: upload_ids).delete_all
   Geo::PackageFileRegistry.where(package_file_id: package_file_ids).delete_all</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for the background jobs to create the registry rows again and resync.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/479852">issue 479852</a> to get feedback on the fix.</p>
<h3>Error <code>end of file reached</code> when running Geo Rake check task on secondary</h3>
<p>You may face the following error when running the <a href="common.md#health-check-rake-task">health check Rake task</a> on the secondary site:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Can connect to the primary node ... no
Reason:
end of file reached
</code></pre>
<p>It might happen if the incorrect URL to the primary site was specified in the setting. To troubleshoot it,
run the following commands in <a href="../../../operations/rails_console.html">the Rails Console</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">primary = Gitlab::Geo.primary_node
primary.internal_uri
Gitlab::HTTP.get(primary.internal_uri, allow_local_requests: true, limit: 10)
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that the value of <code>internal_uri</code> is correct in the previous output.
If the URL of the primary site is incorrect, double-check it in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>, and in <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong>.</p>
<h3>Excessive database IO from Geo metrics collection</h3>
<p>If you're experiencing high database load due to frequent Geo metrics collection, you can reduce the frequency of the <code>geo_metrics_update_worker</code> job. This adjustment can help alleviate database strain in large GitLab instances where metrics collection significantly impacts database performance.</p>
<p>Increasing the interval means that your Geo metrics are updated less frequently. This results in metrics being out-of-date for longer periods of time, which may impact your ability to monitor Geo replication in real-time. If metrics are out-of-date for more than 10 minutes, the site is arbitrarily marked as "Unhealthy" in the Admin Area.</p>
<p>The following example sets the job to run every 30 minutes. Adjust the cron schedule based on your needs.</p>
<p>{{&lt; tabs &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>Add or modify the following setting in <code>/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb</code>:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ruby
   gitlab_rails['geo_metrics_update_worker_cron'] = "*/30 * * * *"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Reconfigure GitLab:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; tab title="Self-compiled (source)" &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit <code>/home/git/gitlab/config/gitlab.yml</code>:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>yaml
   production: &amp;base
     ee_cron_jobs:
       geo_metrics_update_worker:
         cron: "*/30 * * * *"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Save the file and restart GitLab:</li>
</ol>
<p>```shell
   # For systems running systemd
   sudo systemctl restart gitlab.target</p>
<p># For systems running SysV init
   sudo service gitlab restart
   ```</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tab &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; /tabs &gt;}}</p></code></pre>
