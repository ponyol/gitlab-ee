<p>These are the defined terms to describe all aspects of Geo. Using a set of clearly
defined terms helps us to communicate efficiently and avoids confusion. The language

<h2>Replicator terms</h2>
<p>Geo uses replicators to replicate data of individual GitLab components
between primary and secondary sites. They define how the individual <a href="replication/datatypes.md#data-types">data types</a>
of these components have to be processed and verified. For example, data of the
GitLab container registry has to be handled differently than CI job artifacts.
Some components may have more than one replicator which are potentially also
named differently. As such, the following table describes the replicator names
and to which GitLab component they belong.</p>
<p>The same replicator names are also visible in the Geo section of the Admin area
or when using Geo-related console commands.</p>
