<p>This runbook guides you through a planned failover of a single-node Geo site
with one secondary. The following general architecture is assumed:</p>
<p>Primary Site:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitLab node</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary Site:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitLab node</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An offline primary.</li>
<li>A promoted secondary that is now the new primary.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is not covered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-adding the old <strong>primary</strong> as a secondary.</li>
<li>Adding a new secondary.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Before following any of those steps, make sure you have <code>root</code> access to the
<strong>secondary</strong> to promote it because there isn't an automated way to
promote a Geo replica and perform a failover.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>On the <strong>secondary</strong> site, go to the <strong>Admin area</strong> &gt; <strong>Geo</strong> dashboard to
review its status. Replicated objects (shown in green) should be close to 100%,
and there should be no failures (shown in red). If a large proportion of
objects aren't yet replicated (shown in gray), consider giving the site more
time to complete.</p>
<p><img alt="Geo admin dashboard showing the synchronization status of a secondary site." src="img/geo_dashboard_v14_0.png" /></p>
<p>If any objects are failing to replicate, this should be investigated before
scheduling the maintenance window. After a planned failover, anything that
failed to replicate is <strong>lost</strong>.</p>
<p>A common cause of replication failures is the data being missing on the
<strong>primary</strong> site - you can resolve these failures by restoring the data from backup,
or removing references to the missing data.</p>
<p>The maintenance window does not end until Geo replication and verification is
completely finished. To keep the window as short as possible, you should
ensure these processes are close to 100% as possible during active use.</p>
<p>If the <strong>secondary</strong> site is still replicating data from the <strong>primary</strong> site,
follow these steps to avoid unnecessary data loss:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Until a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14609">read-only mode</a>
   is implemented, updates must be prevented from happening manually to the
   <strong>primary</strong>. Your <strong>secondary</strong> site still needs read-only
   access to the <strong>primary</strong> site during the maintenance window:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the scheduled time, using your cloud provider or your site's firewall, block
      all HTTP, HTTPS and SSH traffic to/from the <strong>primary</strong> site, <strong>except</strong> for your IP and
      the <strong>secondary</strong> site's IP.</p>
<p>For instance, you can run the following commands on the <strong>primary</strong> site:</p>
<p>```shell
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <secondary_site_ip> --destination-port 22 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <your_ip> --destination-port 22 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -A INPUT --destination-port 22 -j REJECT</p>
<p>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <secondary_site_ip> --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <your_ip> --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -A INPUT --tcp-dport 80 -j REJECT</p>
<p>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <secondary_site_ip> --destination-port 443 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <your_ip> --destination-port 443 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -A INPUT --tcp-dport 443 -j REJECT
  ```</p>
<p>From this point, users are unable to view their data or make changes on the
  <strong>primary</strong> site. They are also unable to sign in to the <strong>secondary</strong> site.
  However, existing sessions need to work for the remainder of the maintenance period, and
  so public data is accessible throughout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify the <strong>primary</strong> site is blocked to HTTP traffic by visiting it in browser via
      another IP. The server should refuse connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify the <strong>primary</strong> site is blocked to Git over SSH traffic by attempting to pull an
      existing Git repository with an SSH remote URL. The server should refuse
      connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>primary</strong> site:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>On the left sidebar, select <strong>Monitoring</strong> &gt; <strong>Background jobs</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Sidekiq dashboard, select <strong>Cron</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <code>Disable All</code> to disable any non-Geo periodic background jobs.</li>
<li>Select <code>Enable</code> for the <code>geo_sidekiq_cron_config_worker</code> cron job.
     This job re-enables several other cron jobs that are essential for planned
     failover to complete successfully.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish replicating and verifying all data:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="warning" &gt;}}</p>
<p>Not all data is automatically replicated. Read more about
   <a href="../planned_failover.md#not-all-data-is-automatically-replicated">what is excluded</a>.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are manually replicating any
      <a href="../../replication/datatypes.md#replicated-data-types">data not managed by Geo</a>,
      trigger the final replication process now.</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>primary</strong> site:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>On the left sidebar, select <strong>Monitoring</strong> &gt; <strong>Background jobs</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Sidekiq dashboard, select <strong>Queues</strong>, and wait for all queues except
     those with <code>geo</code> in the name to drop to 0.
     These queues contain work that has been submitted by your users; failing over
     before it is completed, causes the work to be lost.</li>
<li>
<p>On the left sidebar, select <strong>Geo</strong> &gt; <strong>Sites</strong> and wait for the
     following conditions to be true of the <strong>secondary</strong> site you are failing over to:</p>
<ul>
<li>All replication meters reach 100% replicated, 0% failures.</li>
<li>All verification meters reach 100% verified, 0% failures.</li>
<li>Database replication lag is 0 ms.</li>
<li>The Geo log cursor is up to date (0 events behind).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>secondary</strong> site:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
<li>On the left sidebar, select <strong>Monitoring</strong> &gt; <strong>Background jobs</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Sidekiq dashboard, select <strong>Queues</strong>, and wait for all the <code>geo</code>
     queues to drop to 0 queued and 0 running jobs.</li>
<li><a href="../../../raketasks/check.html">Run an integrity check</a> to verify the integrity
     of CI artifacts, LFS objects, and uploads in file storage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, your <strong>secondary</strong> site contains an up-to-date copy of everything the
   <strong>primary</strong> site has, meaning nothing is lost when you fail over.</p>
<ol>
<li>In this final step, you need to permanently disable the <strong>primary</strong> site.</li>
</ol>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="warning" &gt;}}</p>
<p>When the <strong>primary</strong> site goes offline, there may be data saved on the <strong>primary</strong> site
   that has not been replicated to the <strong>secondary</strong> site. This data should be treated
   as lost if you proceed.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>If you plan to <a href="../_index.md#step-4-optional-updating-the-primary-domain-dns-record">update the <strong>primary</strong> domain DNS record</a>,
   you may wish to lower the TTL now to speed up propagation.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>When performing a failover, we want to avoid a split-brain situation where
   writes can occur in two different GitLab instances. So to prepare for the
   failover, you must disable the <strong>primary</strong> site:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have SSH access to the <strong>primary</strong> site, stop and disable GitLab:</p>
<p><code>shell
 sudo gitlab-ctl stop</code></p>
<p>Prevent GitLab from starting up again if the server unexpectedly reboots:</p>
<p><code>shell
 sudo systemctl disable gitlab-runsvdir</code></p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>(<strong>CentOS only</strong>) In CentOS 6 or older, there is no easy way to prevent GitLab from being
 started if the machine reboots isn't available (see <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/3058">issue 3058</a>).
 It may be safest to uninstall the GitLab package completely with <code>sudo yum remove gitlab-ee</code>.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
<p>{{&lt; alert type="note" &gt;}}</p>
<p>(<strong>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</strong>) If you are using an older version of Ubuntu
 or any other distribution based on the Upstart init system, you can prevent GitLab
 from starting if the machine reboots as <code>root</code> with
 <code>initctl stop gitlab-runsvvdir &amp;&amp; echo 'manual' &gt; /etc/init/gitlab-runsvdir.override &amp;&amp; initctl reload-configuration</code>.</p>
<p>{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do not have SSH access to the <strong>primary</strong> site, take the machine offline and
     prevent it from rebooting. Because there are many ways you may prefer to accomplish
     this, we avoid a single recommendation. You may need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reconfigure the load balancers.</li>
<li>Change DNS records (for example, point the <strong>primary</strong> DNS record to the
   <strong>secondary</strong> site to stop using the <strong>primary</strong> site).</li>
<li>Stop the virtual servers.</li>
<li>Block traffic through a firewall.</li>
<li>Revoke object storage permissions from the <strong>primary</strong> site.</li>
<li>Physically disconnect a machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Promoting the <strong>secondary</strong> site</h3>
<p>Note the following when promoting a secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <strong>secondary</strong> should not be added at this time. If you want to add a new
  <strong>secondary</strong>, do this after you have completed the entire process of promoting
  the <strong>secondary</strong> to the <strong>primary</strong>.</li>
<li>If you encounter an <code>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name has already been taken</code>
  error during this process, read
  <a href="../failover_troubleshooting.md#fixing-errors-during-a-failover-or-when-promoting-a-secondary-to-a-primary-site">the troubleshooting advice</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To promote the secondary site:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SSH in to your <strong>secondary</strong> site and run one of the following commands:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote the secondary site to primary:</p>
<p><code>shell
 sudo gitlab-ctl geo promote</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote the secondary site to primary <strong>without any further confirmation</strong>:</p>
<p><code>shell
 sudo gitlab-ctl geo promote --force</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify you can connect to the newly promoted <strong>primary</strong> site using the URL used
   previously for the <strong>secondary</strong> site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If successful, the <strong>secondary</strong> site is now promoted to the <strong>primary</strong> site.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>To regain geographic redundancy as quickly as possible, you should
<a href="../../setup/_index.html">add a new <strong>secondary</strong> site</a>. To
do that, you can re-add the old <strong>primary</strong> as a new secondary and bring it back
online.</p></code></pre>
