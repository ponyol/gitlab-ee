<p>When you purchase or use subscriptions for GitLab, you might encounter the following issues.</p>
<h2>Credit card declined</h2>
<p>When you purchase a GitLab subscription, your credit card might be declined because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The credit card details are incorrect. The most common cause for this is an incomplete or fake address.</li>
<li>The credit card account has insufficient funds.</li>
<li>The credit card has expired.</li>
<li>The transaction exceeds the credit limit or the card's maximum transaction amount.</li>
<li>The <a href="#error-transaction_not_allowed">transaction is not allowed</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your financial institution to confirm if any of these reasons apply. If they don't
apply, contact <a href="https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293">GitLab Support</a>.</p>
<h3>Error: <code>transaction_not_allowed</code></h3>
<p>When you purchase a GitLab subscription, you might get an error that states:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Transaction declined.402 - [card_error/card_declined/transaction_not_allowed]
Your card does not support this type of purchase.
</code></pre>
<p>This error indicates that the type of transaction you are making is restricted by your card issuer.
It is a security measure designed to protect your account.</p>
<p>Your transaction might be declined because of one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your card was issued in India and the transaction does not comply with <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12051&amp;Mode=0">RBI's e-mandate rules</a>.</li>
<li>Your card isn't activated for online purchases.</li>
<li>Your card has specific usage limitations.
  For example, it is a debit card that is limited to local transactions only.</li>
<li>The transaction triggers your bank's security protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>To resolve this issue, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For cards issued in India: Process your transaction through an authorized local reseller.
  Reach out to one of the following GitLab partners in India:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/partners/channel-partners/#/1345598">Datamato Technologies Private Limited</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/partners/channel-partners/#/1737250">FineShift Software Private Limited</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For cards issued outside of the United States: Ensure your card is enabled for international use, and verify if there are country-specific restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>Contact your financial institution: Ask for the reason why your transaction was declined, and request that your card is enabled for this type of transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Error: <code>Attempt_Exceed_Limitation</code></h2>
<p>When you purchase a GitLab subscription, you might get the error
<code>Attempt_Exceed_Limitation - Attempt exceed the limitation, refresh page to try again.</code>.</p>
<p>This issue occurs when the credit card form is re-submitted three times within one minute or six times within one hour.
To resolve this issue, wait a few minutes and retry the purchase.</p>
<h2>Error: <code>Subscription not allowed to add</code></h2>
<p>When you purchase subscription add-ons (such as additional seats, compute minutes, storage, or GitLab Duo Pro)
you might get the error <code>Subscription not allowed to add...</code>.</p>
<p>This issue occurs when you have an active subscription that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was <a href="../billing_account.md#subscription-purchased-through-a-reseller">purchased through a reseller</a>.</li>
<li>Is a multi-year subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>To resolve this issue, contact your <a href="https://customers.gitlab.com/contact_us">GitLab sales representative</a> to assist you with the purchase.</p>
<h2>No purchases listed in the Customers Portal account</h2>
<p>To view purchases in the Customers Portal on the <strong>Subscriptions &amp; purchases</strong> page,
you must be added as a contact in your organization for the subscription.</p>
<p>To be added as a contact, <a href="https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293">create a ticket with the GitLab Support team</a>.</p>
<h2>Unable to link subscription to namespace</h2>
<p>On GitLab.com, if you cannot link a subscription to your namespace, you might have insufficient permissions.
Ensure that you have the Owner role for that namespace, and review the <a href="../manage_subscription.md#transfer-restrictions">transfer restrictions</a>.</p>
<h2>Subscription data fails to synchronize</h2>
<p>On GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated, your subscription data might fail to synchronize.
This issue can occur when network traffic between your GitLab instance and certain
IP addresses is not allowed.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, allow network traffic from your GitLab instance to the IP addresses
<code>172.64.146.11:443</code> and <code>104.18.41.245:443</code> (<code>customers.gitlab.com</code>).</p></code></pre>
